                  <strong>A real date picker, and radio/checkbox groups that read as
                  one choice.</strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Date and datetime fields get a proper picker.</strong> The
                    native <code>mm/dd/yyyy</code> input is replaced with a calendar whose
                    header carries a <strong>month dropdown and a year dropdown</strong> —
                    so a date of birth in 1985 is two selections and a click, instead of
                    holding an arrow key. The year list runs 100 years back to 10 forward
                    by default; new <code>minDate</code> / <code>maxDate</code> field
                    options narrow it and grey out days outside the range. Datetime fields
                    keep a time row, and picking a day no longer resets the time to
                    midnight. The panel is portalled, flips above the field when there is
                    no room below, and closes on Escape without also closing the form
                    modal around it.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Radio and checkbox groups render as one divided list.</strong>
                    Options now sit in a single bordered container split by hairlines,
                    each row carrying its control, a bold label and an optional
                    description, with the selected row tinted and its text in the accent
                    colour. Previously they were separate cards floating in a gap, which
                    reads as several independent controls rather than one question with
                    several answers.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Fixed: accent tints that silently rendered as nothing.</strong>
                    The themes declare <code>--accent</code> as a hex, and Tailwind cannot
                    inject an alpha channel into a bare <code>var()</code> — so{' '}
                    <code>bg-accent/10</code> and <code>text-accent/80</code> compiled away
                    entirely. The selected row had no fill at all. These now use{' '}
                    <code>color-mix</code>, which follows whichever theme is active.

                    steps &mdash; and the record you create becomes the selected value.
                    Anything typed into the search box is carried into the new record, and
                    the label appears immediately rather than flashing a raw UUID while the
                    options refetch. The row only appears when the related model is a

                    <strong>Per-step Update on multi-step edit forms.</strong> Editing a
                    record through a stepped form gives every step its own Update button.
                    It is disabled until you change something on that step, saves only that
                    step&rsquo;s fields with <code>PATCH</code>, and goes back to disabled
                    once it lands. Editing the address on step 3 no longer rewrites the
                    twenty fields on steps 1 and 2 with whatever the form happened to be
                    holding. A failed save leaves the step dirty so you can retry rather
                    than showing a step that was never persisted. Applies to both{' '}
                    <code>modal-steps</code> and <code>page-steps</code>; creating still
                    submits once at the end, because a record that does not exist yet has
                    nothing to PATCH against. Set <code>perStepSave: false</code> on the
                    form to keep the old single-submit behaviour.

                    worst way, because it looks right. The parser now resolves string constants,
                    including inside <code>const (…)</code> blocks, and renders anything it still
                    cannot resolve as <code>{'{Name}'}</code> rather than dropping it silently. This
                    had to land first: an MCP tool confidently handing an agent the wrong URL is

                    for any known variable name while iterating a map, so a line mentioning two
                    known groups could pick the wrong parent on some runs and not others.

                    that any client can generate
                    offline with no coordination, but it carries a millisecond timestamp in its high
                    bits, so ids sort chronologically.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Why it matters: index locality.</strong> Random v4 keys scatter inserts
                    across the whole B-tree, so every write dirties a different page and the index
                    fragments as the table grows. Time-ordered keys append to the right-hand edge
                    instead. You also get a free <code>ORDER BY id</code> that means &ldquo;oldest
                    first&rdquo; without a second index on <code>created_at</code>.

                  <li>
                    <strong>The trade-off, stated plainly: v7 ids leak creation time.</strong> The
                    timestamp is readable by anyone holding the id. If you expose raw primary keys
                    in public URLs, you are also publishing when each record was created — and,
                    across two ids, how fast you are growing. That is fine for most applications and
                    wrong for some. If it is wrong for yours, <code>internal/ids</code> is one small
                    file with one function; change <code>New()</code> and every model follows.

                    rows are v7, and nothing needs to be rewritten. Only ids created from this
                    version on will sort chronologically.

                    one is why <code>New()</code> falls back to v4 rather than returning an error: an
                    unordered id is a performance regression, an empty primary key is data

                    revokes their role here too, which is the only reason to map groups at all.
                    Just-in-time provisioning can be turned off for customers who pre-create users.

                    <strong>Identities are linked by subject, not email.</strong> A new{" "}

                    <code>sub</code> first, so someone who changes their email at the identity
                    provider keeps their account and their data instead of silently getting a second
                    one. Email is the fallback, which is also how an existing password user gets
                    linked the first time their company turns SSO on.

                    <strong>Client secrets are encrypted at rest</strong> (the same AES-256-GCM
                    field encryption used elsewhere) and are write-only — the API never returns
                    them, so editing a connection shows a blank field meaning &ldquo;keep what&apos;s
                    stored&rdquo;.

                    <strong>Connections go live without a restart.</strong> Providers are built at
                    boot and rebuilt when a connection is saved. The registry is owned and
                    RWMutex-guarded rather than using goth&apos;s package-level provider map, whose
                    unsynchronised writes would be a fatal concurrent map read/write the moment an
                    admin saved a connection while somebody was signing in. A connection whose
                    discovery fails is logged and skipped so one broken IdP can&apos;t stop everyone
                    else.

                <p>
                  <strong>SAML 2.0 as well.</strong> Pick the protocol per connection. A SAML
                  connection takes the IdP&apos;s metadata (URL or pasted XML) instead of client
                  credentials, and publishes an SP metadata endpoint plus an ACS endpoint for the
                  customer&apos;s IdP admin. The service-provider keypair is generated on first use
                  and its private key encrypted at rest; authentication requests are signed
                  (RSA-SHA256) so providers that require signed requests work without extra setup.
                  IdP-initiated sign-in is on by default, since starting from the provider&apos;s
                  app tile is how most enterprise users actually log in.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Both protocols converge on one identity shape before any account is touched, so
                  SAML inherits the provisioning, identity-linking and role-mapping behaviour OIDC
                  already has tests for rather than growing a second, subtly different copy.

                  <strong>Password reset actually resets the password.</strong> It didn&apos;t
                  before. <code>ForgotPassword</code> generated a token and logged it without
                  storing it; <code>ResetPassword</code> hashed the new password, discarded it
                  with <code>_ = hashedPassword</code>, wrote nothing, and returned
                  &ldquo;Password reset successfully&rdquo;. Anyone who used forgot-password
                  believed they had locked an attacker out and had changed nothing.

                    Completing a reset <strong>revokes every session</strong>. The reason you
                    reset a password is to evict whoever you think is in your account.

                  <li>
                    <code>forgot-password</code> returns an identical response whether the
                    address exists or not, so it can&apos;t be used to enumerate your users.

                    In development the link is logged so you can finish the flow without an
                    email provider. In <strong>production</strong> that&apos;s suppressed — a
                    live reset token in a log file is a credential — and replaced by a loud
                    warning that <code>RESEND_API_KEY</code> is missing.

                  <strong>The landing page ships too.</strong> There was no{" "}
                  <code>/reset-password</code> route, so even a working token would have hit a
                  404. Both admin frontends now have one: it reads the token from the query
                  string, confirms the new password, handles the used / expired / malformed-link
                  cases, and returns you to sign in.

                <p>
                  <strong>Also fixed: <code>grit add web-auth</code> produced a project that

                  <strong>Sessions you can actually revoke.</strong> A JWT is self-contained —
                  once signed it stays valid until it expires, and nothing the server does can
                  take it back. Every refresh token is now backed by a <code>sessions</code> row,
                  which makes &ldquo;sign out this laptop&rdquo;, &ldquo;sign out
                  everywhere&rdquo;, and &ldquo;kill every device when the password
                  changes&rdquo; possible for the first time.

                    badged, per-device sign-out, and &ldquo;sign out of all other devices&rdquo;.

                    <strong>Rotation with replay detection.</strong> Every refresh swaps the
                    token. Presenting an already-rotated one is the signature of theft, so the
                    session is revoked rather than refreshed — surfacing the compromise instead
                    of letting both parties quietly share the account.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Idle <em>and</em> absolute timeouts</strong> (7 and 30 days by
                    default, both overridable). Most apps ship one; auditors ask for both.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Changing a password signs out every other device</strong> and
                    re-issues the caller a fresh session, so they stay signed in.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The raw token is never stored — only its SHA-256 — so a dump of the table
                    cannot be replayed as a login. New endpoints:{" "}
                    <code>GET /api/auth/sessions</code>,{" "}

                  <strong>Security fix — every JWT now carries a unique <code>jti</code>.</strong>{" "}
                  Found while testing this: two tokens minted for the same user in the same
                  second were <em>byte-identical</em> (same claims, same second-resolution{" "}
                  <code>exp</code>, same key), so two devices logging in together shared one
                  refresh token — indistinguishable and impossible to revoke separately. Tokens
                  are now unique per issuance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Proven against a running app, not just compiled: three devices signed in,
                  one revoked, its refresh returning <code>401 SESSION_REVOKED</code> while the
                  others kept working — 22 end-to-end assertions covering revoke-by-id,
                  cross-user isolation, replay detection, password change, revoke-all and
                  logout. Scaffolded projects ship 9 session tests of their own.

                  <strong>Plugins can now depend on real Go modules.</strong> The plugin system
                  documented that a plugin&apos;s <code>GoDeps</code> were &ldquo;added to
                  go.mod&rdquo; — but nothing did that. The field was copied into the lockfile and
                  otherwise ignored. No built-in plugin declared one, so it went unnoticed; any
                  plugin wrapping an external module would have generated code importing something
                  absent from <code>go.mod</code> and failed to build.

                  is exactly what makes it fail. It also means a network error aborts the install

                  <strong>Backups were unrestorable.</strong> A backup you can&apos;t restore is
                  a hope, not a backup — so this one got tested end to end, and it was broken.

                  <code>grit restore</code> runs migrations first (which seed the default ADMIN,
                  EDITOR and USER roles) and then replays the dump — which carries its own copy of
                  those same roles. The dump&apos;s inserts collided with the freshly seeded rows
                  on the unique role-name index, and the entire restore aborted with{" "}
                  <code>duplicate key value violates unique constraint &quot;idx_roles_name&quot;</code>.
                  Every backup was affected.

                <p>
                  Restore now clears the backed-up tables (<code>TRUNCATE … RESTART IDENTITY
                  CASCADE</code>) inside the restore transaction before replaying the dump, so the
                  seeded rows can&apos;t collide and the restored database matches the backup
                  exactly. Verified by restoring a real archive into a fresh Postgres, checking
                  every row count, and logging in with the restored credentials. A regression test
                  guards that restore truncates before it replays.

                  The same mistake predated these screens: the home stat card read{' '}

                  gate their social block, but the Expo login screen rendered it unconditionally

                  It now reads <code>EXPO_PUBLIC_SOCIAL_AUTH_ENABLED</code>, matching the other

                <p>
                  A plugin <strong>generates code into your project</strong> rather than being
                  a runtime dependency &mdash; Grit is a generator, so there is no framework
                  object to hook into. You own the code and can edit or delete it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Removal is exact.</strong> Installation records every file and every
                  injected snippet in <code>.grit/plugins.lock.json</code>, and removal replays
                  it backwards. A plugin author writes no uninstall code at all &mdash; a
                  separate hand-maintained removal list is precisely how this kind of tooling
                  drifts and starts leaving projects that don&apos;t compile. Code you edited
                  by hand is reported, never overwritten.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>The multitenant plugin</strong> adds organizations, per-organization
                  roles (reusing the roles system, not a parallel one), and{' '}
                  <em>automatic</em> query scoping via a GORM callback. Mark a model with{' '}
                  <code>tenant.Owned</code> and every query is scoped for you; opt out
                  deliberately with <code>tenant.Unscoped(db)</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Scoping <strong>fails closed</strong>: a query with no active organization
                  errors rather than quietly returning every tenant&apos;s rows. Hand-written
                  scoping fails the other way &mdash; one forgotten <code>WHERE</code> is a
                  silent cross-tenant leak that no test catches, because the query returns{' '}
                  <em>more</em> rows rather than failing. No subdomains; the active org comes
                  from a header and membership is always verified server-side.

                  <code>NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL</code>. This matters: Vite inlines env at{' '}
                  <em>build</em> time, so setting it on the running container does nothing — a Vite
                  app given the Next.js var silently built against <code>localhost:8080</code> and
                  every API call failed in production.

                <p>
                  Also: the Vite web app now sends security headers from its dev/preview servers
                  (previously only the admin did), via one shared source so web and admin can&apos;t
                  drift. Verified by building and running the image — the SPA serves, all headers
                  are present, the deep-link fallback works, and the API URL is baked into the
                  bundle.

                  Every route in the <code>--vite</code> admin was a hand-written placeholder: the

                  &ldquo;System page content will be loaded here&rdquo;, the profile and auth pages
                  were bare, most sidebar links 404&apos;d, and the 404 itself was TanStack&apos;s

                  uses, transformed by the <code>next-compat</code> layer. 26 real pages and 27
                  routes are generated, including every sidebar destination (

                  After <code>grit generate resource</code>, the admin rendered a blank page and

                </p>
                <p>
                  Cause: the TanStack generator had its own copy of the resource-definition

                  <strong>Offline sync is sharper &mdash; and it no longer gets stuck.</strong>{' '}
                  A desktop app that created a record offline (with an image) could show
                  &ldquo;pending changes&rdquo; forever after reconnecting: the row synced, but the
                  follow-up image-URL update failed server-side. The root cause was the sync push
                  handler calling <code>.Updates(rawMap)</code>, which hands nested JSON fields
                  (a <code>FileRef</code> image, a <code>FileRefs</code> slice, a belongs-to
                  relation) straight to the driver &mdash; Postgres can&apos;t encode a Go map into a
                  json column. The update now decodes into the typed model first (like create does),
                  so <code>driver.Valuer</code> fields round-trip correctly and the outbox clears.
                </p>

                  The <strong>Sync</strong> page in the desktop app got a real upgrade: a live{' '}

                  <strong>auto-sync</strong> toggle (on by default; turn it off to confirm changes
                  by hand), and a richer <strong>Pending changes</strong> tab &mdash; colored
                  create/update/delete badges, the record&apos;s real name, an expandable details
                  view of exactly what will push, and per-row <strong>Confirm</strong> /{' '}

                </p>

                  Under the hood the sync engine gained <code>SetAutoSync</code>,{' '}

                  <strong>Desktop fonts now render (offline), and Performance
                  throughput reads correctly.</strong> Two fixes from desktop
                  polish feedback.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Fonts.</strong> The desktop app pulled its fonts from the
                  Google Fonts CDN — which the Wails webview can&apos;t reach
                  offline — and the body was hardcoded to a font that was never
                  loaded, so everything fell back to the system font. Fonts are now
                  <strong> self-hosted</strong> via <code>@fontsource</code> (bundled
                  by Vite: Inter, Geist, Onest, DM Serif Display, JetBrains Mono) and
                  the body follows the active theme&apos;s font variable. Verified:
                  Inter loads from the bundle with no network and applies to the UI.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Throughput.</strong> The admin Performance page rounded
                  throughput to a whole number, so a real-but-low rate like 0.14
                  req/s displayed as <code>0/s</code>. It now keeps two decimals
                  below 10 req/s (and the desktop page rounds its raw value the same
                  way instead of showing a 17-digit float).

                  desktop resource forms first reached parity: <code>file</code> and{' '}
                  <code>files</code> fields were skipped. They now render a proper

                  chips, single or multiple files, and an <code>accept</code> filter
                  derived from the field&apos;s type (e.g.{' '}
                  <code>cover:file:image</code> only takes images). Uploads go
                  through the API&apos;s <code>/uploads</code> endpoint and store the

                  Because a binary can&apos;t be pushed through the JSON sync outbox,
                  the dropzone is <strong>offline-aware</strong>: when the app
                  can&apos;t reach the server it disables itself with a &quot;reconnect
                  to upload&quot; hint instead of silently failing. No new
                  dependencies — it&apos;s a hidden input plus drag handlers, themed

                  the theme&apos;s brand colours over neutral dark surfaces rather than

                  <code>ValidateConfig</code>, which <code>Mount</code> now runs at
                  startup so config that silently does nothing shows up in the boot
                  log instead of as a 403 weeks later. Running it against Grit&apos;s
                  scaffolded config surfaced two real problems, both now fixed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>1. WAF exclusions never matched.</strong> The WAF matches{' '}
                  <code>ExcludeRoutes</code> against the real request path
                  (<code>c.Request.URL.Path</code>), not gin&apos;s route template — so
                  entries like <code>/api/blogs/:id</code> only ever matched the
                  literal string <code>:id</code>, never <code>/api/blogs/123</code>.
                  Five of seven excluded routes were dead. In production
                  (<code>ModeBlock</code>) that meant editing a blog/post/article with
                  richtext was WAF-inspected and its <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>/<code>&lt;img&gt;</code>{' '}
                  tags flagged as XSS — a 403 on every rich-text save, and on both
                  public form-share endpoints. Now uses subtree wildcards
                  (<code>/api/blogs/*</code>), verified against real URLs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>2. Security data was being thrown away on every deploy.</strong>{' '}
                  Grit passed its <code>*gorm.DB</code> but never set{' '}
                  <code>Storage</code>, so Sentinel silently fell back to a local{' '}
                  <code>sentinel.db</code> SQLite file — ephemeral inside a container,
                  so each redeploy dropped the threat log and blocked-IP list. Storage
                  is now set explicitly, pointing at the app&apos;s Postgres (falling
                  back to SQLite when the app itself runs on SQLite).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Also picks up Sentinel v2.1.2 (globstar route patterns after segment
                  wildcards). Grit&apos;s config now validates with zero errors and zero

                    base64url (which includes <code>-</code>), so a cookie holding
                    two tokens contains <code>--</code> about 9% of the time — and it
                    re-rolled on every token refresh, so it looked like flaky
                    networking, not a firewall. Fixed upstream in Sentinel v2.1.1.

                  <strong>Fix: request bodies larger than 4 KB were silently
                  truncated.</strong> Pulse&apos;s error-tracking middleware
                  captures a request-body snippet for error context, but it
                  restored <em>only</em> that snippet to the request — discarding
                  everything past <code>MaxBodySize</code> (default 4096 bytes).
                  Every request that sends a <code>Content-Length</code> (mobile
                  apps, native/CLI clients, <code>curl</code>) reached handlers
                  with a body cut to 4 KB, so <strong>file uploads and any large
                  JSON POST failed</strong> with confusing &quot;no file&quot; /
                  parse errors. Browsers were unaffected because <code>fetch</code>
                  sends multipart <em>chunked</em> (no Content-Length), which
                  skipped the capture — which is why the web dropzone always
                  worked while mobile never did.

                  <strong>Fix: image uploads from the Expo app.</strong> Uploads
                  were failing with <code>400 &quot;No file provided&quot;</code>{' '}

                  <code>uploadAsync</code> sends an empty body under the New
                  Architecture on SDK 54 (the request landed in a few ms with no
                  file). The mobile upload helper now uses{' '}
                  <code>fetch</code> + <code>FormData</code> with a React Native
                  file descriptor and — crucially — never sets{' '}
                  <code>Content-Type</code> by hand, so fetch keeps the multipart
                  boundary intact. Fixes avatar, blog and every generated

                </p>
                <p>
                  The <code>/uploads</code> handler is also more robust: it falls
                  back to the first file part under any field name and logs the
                  request&apos;s content-type + fields when a file is genuinely

                  When a project has an <code>apps/expo</code> app, generating a resource also

                  create/update/delete mutations), a <strong>paginated list screen</strong>, and a{' '}

                  Every <code>belongs_to</code> resource is now filterable by its foreign key —{' '}
                  <code>GET /products?category_id=…</code> returns just that parent&apos;s children,
                  and the generated hook takes the same filter. This is what powers a real
                  category → products browse flow on mobile.

                  a floating glass tab bar lifted above the Android system nav, safe-area page

                  <strong>Mobile (Expo) scaffold fixes.</strong> A fresh <code>--mobile</code>
                  app now starts cleanly with correct dependency versions and real app icons.
                </p>

                <h3>App icons &amp; splash now ship with the scaffold</h3>
                <p>
                  <code>app.json</code> referenced <code>./assets/icon.png</code> and
                  <code>./assets/splash.png</code>, but those files were never generated — so
                  Metro failed with <em>&ldquo;Unable to resolve asset&rdquo;</em>. The Grit logo
                  is now embedded in the CLI and written to <code>icon.png</code>,
                  <code>splash.png</code>, <code>adaptive-icon.png</code>, and
                  <code>favicon.png</code> on scaffold (with matching Android adaptive-icon and
                  web favicon entries in <code>app.json</code>). The same brand logo is also
                  dropped into the web, admin, and single-app <code>public/</code> folders.
                </p>

                <h3>Expo dependency versions aligned to SDK 54</h3>
                <p>
                  The Expo app pinned <code>expo</code> 54 but shipped SDK-53 versions of a few
                  packages, triggering compatibility warnings. Bumped
                  <code>expo-image</code> (~3.0.11), <code>expo-haptics</code> (~15.0.8),
                  <code>expo-web-browser</code> (~15.0.11), <code>react-native</code> (0.81.5),
                  and <code>typescript</code> (~5.9.2). On an existing project you can also run
                  <code>npx expo install --fix</code>.

                  <strong>Self-update fix.</strong> <code>grit update</code> could report
                  success but leave no <code>grit</code> on your PATH.
                </p>

                <h3>go install now targets grit&apos;s real location</h3>
                <p>
                  When grit was installed via the install script (into <code>~/.grit/bin</code>),
                  the update&apos;s <code>go install</code> step wrote the new binary to the Go
                  default <code>GOBIN</code> (<code>~/go/bin</code>) instead — while the running
                  binary had already been renamed aside. The result: <em>&ldquo;Updated to
                  vX&rdquo;</em> followed by <code>grit: No such file or directory</code>. The
                  updater now sets <code>GOBIN</code> to the directory grit actually lives in, so
                  the refreshed binary lands exactly where your PATH expects it. If you hit this on
                  an older version, recover with{' '}

                  <strong>Windows dev fix.</strong> <code>grit start</code> no longer fails
                  to boot the frontend on machines where Turborepo&apos;s native binary can&apos;t load.

                  (STATUS_DLL_NOT_FOUND) because turbo ships a platform-specific native binary that
                  needs the Visual C++ runtime — which blocked <code>grit start</code> on a fresh
                  machine. The scaffolded root <code>dev</code> script now uses pnpm&apos;s own
                  parallel runner (<code>pnpm --parallel --filter &quot;./apps/*&quot; --if-present run dev</code>),
                  which needs no native binary, so the web and admin dev servers always come up.
                  Turbo is kept for <code>build</code> / <code>lint</code> / <code>test</code> where
                  its caching helps.

                  <strong>Form-sharing polish.</strong> Four fixes
                  from one fresh-project test session, all on the{' '}
                  <code>/system/form-shares</code> surface.
                </p>

                <h3>1. Resource is now a dropdown, not a text input</h3>
                <p>
                  Typing <code>Catgeory</code> instead of{' '}
                  <code>Category</code> in the New Share modal
                  silently created a broken share -- the dispatcher
                  fell through to <code>default</code>, the public
                  form showed an empty state, and the operator
                  didn&apos;t find out until a customer hit it. The
                  modal now lists every registered resource in a{' '}
                  <code>&lt;select&gt;</code>, sourced from a new{' '}
                  <code>GET /api/admin/form-shares/resources</code>{' '}
                  endpoint.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Form preview with per-field hide toggles</h3>
                <p>
                  Once a resource is picked, the modal renders a
                  preview of the public form: every field with its
                  type, required/optional badge, and a{' '}
                  <em>Hide</em> checkbox for each optional one.
                  Required fields can&apos;t be hidden (the submit
                  would 422). The selected hidden keys persist with
                  the share and the public-form endpoint filters
                  them out server-side -- so anonymous visitors
                  never see a column the operator marked private.
                </p>

                <h3>3. Custom title + description on the public form</h3>
                <p>
                  The public form&apos;s heading used to be{' '}
                  <code>{`<resource> submission`}</code> + a
                  hardcoded <em>&ldquo;Fill out the form below to
                  submit a new <code>{`<resource>`}</code>.&rdquo;</em>{' '}
                  Both can now be customised per share in the New
                  Share modal. Title falls back through three
                  sources -- custom_title → label → resource name
                  -- so old shares keep working with the same
                  heading they had before.
                </p>

                <h3>4. The public form actually renders the right fields now</h3>
                <p>
                  <strong>This was the big one.</strong> v3.31.43
                  fixed{' '}
                  <code>services/form_share_dispatch.go</code> to
                  return the resource&apos;s real field schema
                  (via reflection) -- but the matching change to{' '}
                  <code>webPublicFormPage()</code> in the framework
                  scaffold never landed. Every project scaffolded
                  with v3.31.43 through v3.31.49 was shipping a
                  hardcoded name / email / phone / message contact
                  form, regardless of what the resource actually
                  looked like.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The scaffold&apos;s public form page is now the
                  fields-aware version: reads the new{' '}
                  <code>fields[]</code>{' '}, <code>custom_title</code>,
                  <code> custom_description</code> from the API
                  and renders one input per field with the right
                  HTML shape (text / email / tel / textarea /
                  number / checkbox / date / datetime / file).
                </p>
                <p>
                  For projects already scaffolded with the stale
                  page, the upgrade is a one-file copy:{' '}
                  <code>apps/web/app/forms/[token]/page.tsx</code>{' '}
                  from a fresh scaffold replaces the broken one.
                </p>

                <h3>Plus: Edit modal now scaffolds in fresh projects</h3>
                <p>
                  v3.31.43 added an Edit button to the form-shares
                  table -- but only as a hand-applied patch to the
                  ecom test project, never in the scaffold. v3.31.50
                  ships it properly: a <em>Pencil</em> button on
                  each row opens an Edit modal with the same
                  preview + hide toggles + title / description /
                  password controls.
                </p>

                <h3>Data model</h3>
                <p>
                  <code>models.FormShare</code> gains three columns:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <code>custom_title</code> /{' '}
                    <code>custom_description</code> -- short strings
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <code>hidden_fields</code> -- JSON array of
                    field keys to omit
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  GORM AutoMigrate adds them on next boot. The new{' '}

                  <strong>Three small ergonomic wins from real
                  operator feedback.</strong> All three landed
                  together in v3.31.49.
                </p>

                <h3>1. Activity log shows the operator&apos;s real IP, not &quot;::1&quot;</h3>
                <p>
                  Local-dev activity rows showed{' '}
                  <code>::1</code> in the IP column because
                  gin&apos;s <code>ClientIP()</code> correctly
                  reports the IPv6 loopback for same-machine
                  traffic. Operators expect to see their actual
                  public IP.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The admin / web axios clients now fetch the
                  operator&apos;s public IP once per session
                  (cached in <code>sessionStorage</code>; sourced
                  from <code>api.ipify.org</code>) and attach it
                  as <code>X-Public-IP-Hint</code> on every API
                  call. The new{' '}
                  <code>services.ResolveClientIP</code> helper
                  honours the hint <em>only</em> when the TCP peer
                  is loopback, so production traffic from real
                  proxies (which sets <code>X-Forwarded-For</code>{' '}
                  for gin to consume) keeps using the trusted path
                  and can&apos;t be spoofed by a client header.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When the lookup fails (offline / ad-blocker), the
                  feed falls back to the prior behaviour and
                  renders <code>localhost (::1)</code> with the
                  raw value tucked next to it so the origin stays
                  inspectable.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Web navbar gets an Admin CTA back</h3>
                <p>
                  v3.31.42 replaced the navbar&apos;s Admin link
                  with the v3.31.42 UserMenu (Login / Sign up +
                  avatar dropdown). Operators landing on the
                  marketing site lost the one-click bounce to the
                  admin app and had to type the URL by hand.
                </p>
                <p>
                  v3.31.49 puts an Admin button back in the
                  navbar, both in the base scaffold (no-auth, post
                  v3.31.48) and in the auth-aware variant. Points
                  at <code>NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_URL</code> (defaults
                  to <code>http://localhost:3001</code> for dev;
                  set to your prod admin origin before shipping).
                </p>

                <h3>3. Landing page surfaces all the dev URLs</h3>
                <p>
                  The <code>grit new</code> welcome banner prints
                  every URL the scaffold ships with: API, API
                  Docs, GORM Studio, Sentinel, Pulse, Admin,
                  MinIO, Mailhog. Once the terminal scrolls past,
                  operators have to dig back through history to
                  find the right one.

                  function (App / API / Data / Ops) and colour-
                  coded. The whole section is wrapped in a{' '}
                  <code>NODE_ENV !== &quot;production&quot;</code>{' '}
                  check at module level so production marketing
                  pages never leak the internal port map -- the
                  section disappears from the prod bundle
                  entirely, not just hidden behind a class.

                  <strong>Two bug fixes from real user feedback on
                  v3.31.47.</strong> Both happened on fresh{' '}
                  <code>grit new</code> scaffolds: a broken Go file
                  from a marker collision, and web auth shipping by
                  default when it should be opt-in.
                </p>

                <h3>1. injectBefore now matches marker as a standalone line</h3>
                <p>
                  The generator&apos;s <code>injectBefore</code>{' '}
                  did a raw <code>strings.Index</code> on the
                  marker. Markers like{' '}
                  <code>// grit:form-share:fields</code> sometimes
                  appear inside the docstring of the function they
                  precede (&ldquo;...at the marker comment...&rdquo;).
                  The substring match landed there <em>first</em>{' '}
                  and the case got injected into the comment, not
                  the function body -- producing a syntax error.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The matcher now walks line-by-line and requires
                  the trimmed line content to equal the marker
                  exactly. Docstrings that mention the marker by
                  name are safe again, and the form-share
                  scaffolded comments stay readable.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Web auth is now opt-in via grit add web-auth</h3>
                <p>
                  The base web scaffold has been quietly shipping
                  the full auth surface since v3.28.1: login /
                  register / forgot-password / callback pages, the
                  five themed AuthShells, the useAuth hook,
                  AuthProvider, UserMenu, the web-session marker,
                  and Login / Sign up buttons in the navbar. That
                  was always intended to be{' '}
                  <strong>opt-in</strong> via{' '}
                  <code>grit add web-auth</code> -- the base
                  scaffold should be a clean marketing site with no
                  auth UI.
                </p>
                <p>
                  v3.31.48 moves all of those files into{' '}

                  <li>
                    Base scaffold: navbar shows Home / Blog / Docs
                    / GitHub only, no Login / Sign up. AppChrome
                    keeps <code>/forms/&lt;token&gt;</code> as the
                    only chromeless prefix (for public form-share).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <code>grit add web-auth</code> now writes
                    everything: hooks/use-auth.ts,
                    lib/auth-provider.tsx, lib/web-session.ts, the
                    four (auth) pages, the five themed shells,
                    UserMenu, middleware.ts, ProtectedWebRoute.tsx
                    -- and REPLACES the navbar + AppChrome with
                    their auth-aware variants (which add the
                    (auth) chromeless prefixes and the UserMenu in
                    the navbar). Replacement requires{' '}

                <h3>Migrating existing projects</h3>
                <p>
                  Projects scaffolded with v3.31.x before this
                  release already have the auth files. They keep
                  working unchanged -- no removal happens
                  automatically. Future <code>grit new</code> calls
                  produce the clean base scaffold; if you need auth
                  on a fresh project, run{' '}

                <h3>Both bugs were reported same day</h3>
                <p>
                  The user spun up a fresh ecom-app, hit the
                  form-share dispatch syntax error on
                  <code>grit dev</code>, then noticed the web
                  shipping auth they didn&apos;t want. Both shipped
                  fixed in v3.31.48 within a few hours.

                  <strong>The Preset Chart builder.</strong> Operators
                  can now build custom charts straight from Dashboard
                  Settings -- pick a resource, pick a preset, pick a
                  visualization. The charts render in the Charts
                  section alongside the system Activity + Severity
                  widgets. No SQL involved.
                </p>

                <h3>Four presets</h3>
                <p>
                  The presets cover the bulk of admin-dashboard needs
                  without introducing a query plane:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Count over time</strong> -- daily count
                    of new records (no field needed)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Group by field</strong> -- top-N counts
                    grouped by a categorical column (e.g. orders by
                    status, products by category)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Sum over time</strong> -- daily sum of a
                    numeric column (e.g. revenue per day)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Avg over time</strong> -- daily average
                    of a numeric column (e.g. average order value)
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Five visualizations</h3>
                <p>
                  Each chart renders as <code>bar</code>,{' '}
                  <code>line</code>, <code>area</code>,{' '}
                  <code>pie</code>, or <code>donut</code> -- using
                  Recharts. The builder dims out incompatible
                  combinations (pie for a time-series, line for
                  group_by) so users see why a choice doesn&apos;t
                  make sense rather than picking a broken combo
                  and getting a flat chart.
                </p>

                <h3>How it works under the hood</h3>
                <p>
                  Same dispatch pattern as the v3.31.44 resource
                  stats. A new service file{' '}
                  <code>chart_dispatch.go</code> ships with a
                  switch over resource name + a reflective helper
                  that runs the right SQL for each preset:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <code>count_over_time</code>: pulls timestamps
                    + buckets in-memory (portable across SQLite + Postgres)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <code>group_by</code>: SQL{' '}
                    <code>GROUP BY field ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT N</code>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <code>sum_over_time</code> /{' '}
                    <code>avg_over_time</code>: pulls (created_at, field)
                    pairs + aggregates in-memory
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Field whitelisting is the security boundary: the
                  helper reflects on the model to build two sets
                  (string/bool columns valid for group_by, numeric
                  columns valid for sum/avg) and rejects any field
                  not in the right set. The same dispatch marker
                  used by v3.31.44 (<code>{`// grit:resource-stats:dispatch`}</code>)
                  is reused, so one generator injection covers both
                  the sparkline + the chart presets for a new
                  resource.
                </p>

                <h3>New endpoint</h3>
                <p>
                  <code>GET /api/admin/dashboard/chart/:resource?preset=group_by&amp;field=status&amp;limit=10</code>
                  {' '}returns{' '}
                  <code>{`{ data: { preset, rows: [{x, y}], meta } }`}</code>.
                  The frontend ChartCard renders the right Recharts
                  component based on the saved viz; the{' '}
                  <code>{`{x, y}`}</code> shape works for all four
                  presets without a discriminator.
                </p>

                <h3>Data model</h3>
                <p>
                  <code>models.DashboardLayout</code> gains one new
                  JSON column:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <code>custom_charts</code> -- array of user-defined
                    chart configs. The PUT handler validates each entry
                    on write (drops malformed rows individually rather
                    than rejecting the whole save).
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  GORM AutoMigrate adds the column on next boot. No
                  manual migration; existing saved layouts continue to
                  work (empty array = no custom charts).
                </p>

                <h3>Frontend pieces</h3>
                <p>
                  Three new files in the admin scaffold:

                  </li>
                  <li>

                    picker (with tiles), field picker (filtered by

                    incompatible). Used in the new{' '}

                <h3>Research note</h3>
                <p>
                  The design is the &ldquo;Preset Charts&rdquo;
                  pattern from the research pass (Metabase, Grafana,
                  Looker Studio, Superset, Power BI). It&apos;s the
                  table-first pattern with curated presets rather
                  than the dimension/metric drag-drop pattern --
                  fits Grit&apos;s convention-over-configuration
                  audience and slots straight into the v3.31.45
                  settings page. The dimension/metric builder
                  (Design B from the research) stays available as
                  a future v3.32 upgrade if users start asking for
                  one more axis of freedom.

                  thumbnails, columns with{' '}
                  <code>format: &quot;badge&quot;</code> render the
                  configured pill, dates and currency get their
                  normal formatting. The column picker still uses
                  the v3.31.44 heuristics (prefer{' '}
                  <code>name</code>/<code>title</code>/<code>email</code>/
                  <code>status</code>/<code>price</code>) but now
                  always reserves a slot for any image / FileRef
                  column so visual rows always have a thumbnail when
                  the model defines one.
                </p>

                <h3>Per-resource layout toggle: Split vs Tabs</h3>
                <p>
                  The v3.31.44 layout was hardcoded:{' '}
                  <strong>Split</strong> (Total card ~33% on the
                  left, Latest table ~67% on the right). That ratio
                  breaks down for resources with many columns or
                  long string values -- the Latest table never has
                  room to breathe. v3.31.46 adds a per-resource
                  layout mode:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Split</strong> (default) -- the v3.31.44
                    side-by-side layout.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Tabs</strong> -- both widgets render
                    full-width inside a tabbed container. Two tabs
                    (<em>Total &lt;Resource&gt;</em> / <em>Latest
                    &lt;Resource&gt;</em>) with the Latest tab
                    opened by default since that&apos;s the widget
                    that benefits most from the extra width.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Picked per resource in Dashboard Settings under
                  the new <em>Resource layout</em> panel (below the
                  By Resource checkboxes). Only resources with at
                  least one widget enabled show up in the picker --
                  the choice is moot otherwise.
                </p>

                <h3>Data model</h3>
                <p>
                  <code>models.DashboardLayout</code> gains one new
                  JSON column:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <code>resource_layouts</code> -- a string-keyed
                    object (<code>{`{ "products": "tabs", "orders": "split" }`}</code>).
                    Only non-default (<code>tabs</code>) entries are
                    persisted; missing slugs fall back to{' '}
                    <code>split</code> at render time. The PUT
                    handler validates incoming values and silently
                    drops anything that isn&apos;t{' '}
                    <code>split</code> or <code>tabs</code>.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  GORM AutoMigrate adds the column on next boot. No
                  manual migration; existing saved layouts continue
                  to work (an empty map means &ldquo;every resource
                  uses split&rdquo; -- the v3.31.44 behaviour).
                </p>

                <h3>Coming in v3.31.47</h3>
                <p>
                  Next release will tackle the &ldquo;build a custom
                  chart&rdquo; ask -- give operators a way to pick a
                  resource + group-by field + aggregation +
                  visualization (bar/line/pie/donut) without writing
                  SQL. The design landed on the &ldquo;Preset
                  Charts&rdquo; pattern (count over time,{' '}
                  <em>group by field</em>, sum/avg over time, top-N)
                  -- those four cover the bulk of admin-dashboard
                  needs without introducing a query plane, and slot
                  straight into the same Dashboard Settings page as
                  the v3.31.45 toggles.

                  <strong>Per-resource dashboard customisation + section reordering.</strong>{' '}
                  The v3.31.44 &ldquo;By Resource&rdquo; band was
                  uncustomisable — it always rendered the Total +
                  Latest pair for every resource. Dashboard Settings
                  now exposes both halves per resource, and the four
                  top-level dashboard sections (Cards, Charts,
                  Tables, By Resource) can be reordered.
                </p>

                <h3>Per-resource toggles in Dashboard Settings</h3>
                <p>
                  A new <em>By Resource</em> section appears at the
                  bottom of <code>/settings/dashboard</code>, grouped
                  by resource. Each resource exposes two checkboxes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Total <em>&lt;Resource&gt;</em></strong>{' '}
                    — the stat card with the 30-day sparkline.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Latest <em>&lt;Resource&gt;</em></strong>{' '}
                    — the newest-N records table.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Toggling either one off hides just that widget; the
                  row stretches the visible half to fill the
                  available width. Resources with both halves
                  unchecked don&apos;t render at all. The
                  resource-level <code>{`dashboard: { enabled: false }`}</code>{' '}
                  opt-out still exists for resources that should
                  never appear on the dashboard, even as catalog
                  entries.
                </p>

                <h3>Section reorder</h3>
                <p>
                  A new <strong>Section order</strong> panel sits at
                  the top of Dashboard Settings, showing the four
                  sections as a numbered list with up/down chevrons.
                  The saved order persists on the existing{' '}
                  <code>DashboardLayout</code> row (new{' '}
                  <code>section_order</code> column). The dashboard
                  page renders the sections in that order using CSS{' '}
                  <code>order</code> on a flex container — no JSX
                  restructure was needed.
                </p>

                <h3>Data model — two new JSON columns</h3>
                <p>
                  <code>models.DashboardLayout</code> gains two
                  fields, both JSON arrays:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <code>resources</code> — enabled keys for the
                    By Resource band, formatted as{' '}
                    <code>{`"<slug>:total"`}</code> /{' '}
                    <code>{`"<slug>:latest"`}</code>. Same
                    presence-vs-absence semantics as the existing{' '}
                    <code>cards</code> / <code>charts</code> /{' '}
                    <code>tables</code> arrays: an empty list on a
                    saved row means &ldquo;hide everything&rdquo;;
                    a missing row means &ldquo;show defaults.&rdquo;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <code>section_order</code> — section keys in
                    render order. Default empty (= built-in order).
                    Unknown keys are silently dropped at render
                    time; missing default keys get appended to the
                    end so a saved layout from before a new section
                    was added still renders the new section.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Backward compatibility</h3>
                <p>
                  Pre-v3.31.45 projects don&apos;t have the new
                  columns. GORM AutoMigrate adds them on next boot.
                  Existing saved layouts continue to work — both new
                  arrays default to empty, which means &ldquo;use
                  built-in defaults&rdquo; (all resource widgets
                  shown, default section order). Frontend{' '}
                  <code>SavedLayout</code> gains the two fields as
                  required (TypeScript-side); the wire shape allows
                  them to be omitted on the PUT body, treated as
                  empty.

                  Every newly generated resource now ships with two
                  preset widgets on the main dashboard: a{' '}
                  <strong>Total stat card with a 30-day sparkline</strong>{' '}
                  on the left and a <strong>Latest 5 records</strong>{' '}
                  preview on the right. Both honor the existing

                  obeys whichever range the operator has selected.
                </p>

                <h3>How it works</h3>
                <p>
                  Three pieces ship together:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Service</strong>:{' '}
                    <code>services.ComputeResourceStats</code> in{' '}
                    <code>apps/api/internal/services/resource_stats_dispatch.go</code>{' '}
                    — a generator-driven switch over resource name,
                    each case calls a single reflective helper that
                    counts rows in the active range, builds a
                    30-day sparkline, and lists the newest N (JSON
                    round-tripped so <code>json:&quot;-&quot;</code>{' '}
                    columns like <code>PasswordHash</code> never leak).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Endpoint</strong>:{' '}
                    <code>GET /api/admin/dashboard/resource-stats/:resource</code>{' '}
                    — accepts the same{' '}

                    <code>created_from</code> /{' '}
                    <code>created_to</code> params the resource list
                    pages already use, so the wire shape matches.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Widgets</strong>:{' '}
                    <code>ResourceStatCard</code>,{' '}
                    <code>ResourceLatestTable</code>, and a thin{' '}
                    <code>ResourceWidgetsRow</code> wrapper. The
                    dashboard page maps over registered resources
                    and renders one row per resource below the
                    existing Quick Access section.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Sparkline window is always 30 days</h3>
                <p>
                  The sparkline ignores the active date filter on
                  purpose — under the &ldquo;Today&rdquo; preset
                  it would collapse to a single bar, which carries
                  no information. The total + latest list still
                  obey the filter; only the trend chart is fixed.
                </p>

                <h3>Opt-out per resource</h3>
                <p>
                  Resources can hide their widgets by setting{' '}
                  <code>dashboard: {`{ enabled: false }`}</code>{' '}
                  in the resource definition. The flag is opt-out
                  by design: a new resource is more often than not
                  worth showing on the dashboard.
                </p>

                <h3>Backward compatibility</h3>
                <p>
                  The generator injects a switch case into{' '}

                  Projects scaffolded before v3.31.44 don&apos;t
                  have the file or the marker — the generator
                  detects this and prints a one-line warning
                  instead of failing. Patch existing projects by
                  copying the scaffold file from the framework
                  repo, then re-running{' '}
                  <code>grit generate</code> to populate the cases

                  coincidence. Submitting any other field shape was
                  effectively impossible.

                  <code>services.PublicFields(resourceName)</code>,
                  a per-resource switch that reflects the model
                  struct and returns a typed{' '}
                  <code>PublicFieldInfo[]</code> with one entry per
                  user-facing column (framework + auto fields are
                  skipped). The HTTP type for each field is
                  inferred from the Go type:{' '}
                  <code>FileRef → file</code>,{' '}
                  <code>time.Time → datetime</code>,{' '}
                  <code>bool → checkbox</code>,{' '}
                  <code>int/float → number</code>, and{' '}
                  <code>string</code> with name heuristics for
                  email / phone / textarea fields.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <code>GET /api/public/forms/:token</code> now
                  returns a <code>fields[]</code> array alongside{' '}
                  <code>resource_name</code> and{' '}
                  <code>has_password</code>. The web page consumes
                  it and renders one input per field, with proper
                  shapes for checkbox, number, textarea, and
                  date/datetime. File fields render an inline
                  &ldquo;File uploads aren&apos;t supported on
                  public-share forms&rdquo; explainer instead of an
                  unusable input — file uploads require the
                  auth-gated <code>/api/uploads</code> endpoint and
                  aren&apos;t supported on anonymous shares yet.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Admin can edit existing shares</h3>
                <p>
                  The admin form-shares page already had Audit /
                  Copy / Open / Delete buttons but no way to change
                  a share&apos;s label or password protection after
                  creation. Want to add a password to an existing
                  link? Delete + recreate, and re-distribute the
                  new token to every recipient.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A new <strong>Edit</strong> button opens a modal
                  with three controls:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>

                    <em>Remove password</em>. &ldquo;Remove&rdquo;
                    is disabled when the share has no password.

                  <code>PATCH /api/admin/form-shares/:id</code>{' '}
                  already supported the full payload (it accepts{' '}
                  <code>password: &quot;-&quot;</code> as the
                  sentinel for &ldquo;remove&rdquo;); this release
                  just adds the missing UI to call it.

                <h3>Backward compatibility</h3>
                <p>
                  Projects scaffolded before v3.31.43 don&apos;t
                  have the <code>{`// grit:form-share:fields`}</code>{' '}
                  marker or the <code>reflect</code> +{' '}
                  <code>strings</code> imports the new code
                  depends on. The generator now adds the imports
                  lazily on the first generated resource and prints
                  a one-line warning when the marker is missing,
                  pointing operators at a manual patch. Existing
                  shares keep working — they just continue to show
                  the hardcoded form until the project is
                  re-scaffolded or the dispatcher is patched.

                <h3>1. Auth pages render full-bleed (no navbar / footer)</h3>
                <p>
                  Until now the web app&apos;s <code>(auth)/login</code>,{' '}
                  <code>(auth)/register</code>, <code>(auth)/forgot-password</code>,{' '}
                  <code>(auth)/callback</code>, and <code>forms/[token]</code>{' '}
                  pages all rendered inside the root layout, which
                  pinned the <code>&lt;Navbar /&gt;</code> +{' '}
                  <code>&lt;Footer /&gt;</code> to the top and bottom.
                  The auth pages already supply their own{' '}
                  <code>AuthShell</code> chrome (same template the
                  admin uses) so the result was visually doubled.

                  New <code>components/AppChrome.tsx</code> is a tiny
                  client wrapper that conditionally renders Navbar +
                  Footer based on the pathname. The root layout drops
                  to a thin server component again. Auth + public
                  form-share pages render full-bleed; everything else
                  is unchanged.

                <h3>2. grit_web_session marker stops admin sessions from unlocking web pages</h3>
                <p>
                  <code>grit_access</code> is set by the API on the
                  API origin (<code>localhost:8080</code>). That same
                  cookie is also used by <code>apps/admin</code> — so
                  an operator who signed in via the admin app could
                  open <code>apps/web/account</code> in the same
                  browser and walk straight past the web middleware.
                  The API call from <code>useMe()</code> succeeded
                  (the cookie is valid), and{' '}
                  <code>ProtectedWebRoute</code> happily rendered the
                  page.

                <p>
                  New <code>grit_web_session</code> marker cookie is
                  set by the web app&apos;s own login/register flow
                  on the WEB origin (<code>localhost:3000</code>) via
                  client JS — non-HttpOnly, intentionally — and
                  cleared by logout. Middleware reads{' '}
                  <code>grit_web_session</code> instead of{' '}
                  <code>grit_access</code>. Admin-only sessions never
                  stamp the marker, so the web gates bounce them. The
                  real session security is unchanged: useMe() still
                  validates the API JWT; the marker is just a fast
                  edge check.

                  two course lessons rewritten to match what actually
                  happens.</strong> No code-behavior changes — this
                  release closes the gap between the documentation
                  and the running system.
                </p>

                <h3>System Hub tile</h3>
                <p>
                  The <code>/system/form-shares</code> page has
                  existed since v3.31.20 but wasn&apos;t reachable
                  from the <code>/system</code> tile grid — operators
                  had to know the URL by heart. The course lesson
                  pointed users at &quot;System → Public form
                  sharing&quot; which only existed as a sidebar
                  shortcut, not as a Hub tile. Now both surfaces
                  carry it. The tile shows up in all four System Hub
                  variants (default <code>admin_v331_files.go</code>{' '}
                  + minimal/modern/glass via{' '}
                  <code>admin_v3315_pages.go</code>).
                </p>

                <h3>public-form-sharing lesson</h3>
                <p>
                  Fixed the navigation reference (System Hub tile vs
                  direct route) and added a new section on file
                  upload limitations. The default{' '}
                  <code>/forms/[token]</code> template renders text
                  inputs only — <code>:file:</code> /{' '}
                  <code>:files:</code> / <code>:image:</code>{' '}
                  columns are silently skipped because{' '}
                  <code>/api/uploads</code> is auth-gated. The lesson
                  now walks through three production-shaped
                  workarounds (presigned URLs, external links,
                  magic-link auth).
                </p>

                  Added a deep &quot;Behind the scenes: how the auth
                  bypass actually works&quot; section that walks the
                  four security layers operators should understand
                  before shipping a <code>--public-share</code> form
                  to production:

                  <li>
                    The dispatcher service is the real security

                  <li>
                    The optional bcrypt password on the FormShare row

                  <strong>Per-user dashboard customisation + dashboard
                  date filter.</strong> A new Settings → Dashboard page
                  lets each operator pick which stat cards, charts, and
                  tables show up on their dashboard, grouped by module.
                  The dashboard also gets a date-window filter that
                  scopes every stat and chart to the selected range.

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    New handler exposing{' '}
                    <code>GET /api/dashboard-layout</code> (returns
                    the current user&apos;s saved layout or a
                    zero-valued struct if none) and{' '}

                    <code>cards: []</code> = &quot;hide every stat

                    checking <code>layout.id</code>.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Widget catalog</h3>
                <p>
                  New <code>lib/dashboard-catalog.ts</code> aggregates
                  the catalog of pickable widgets from two sources:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>System</strong> widgets (Users, Events 24h,
                    Notifications, Resources count, Activity 7-day
                    chart, Severity mix, Recent activity, Quick
                    access) — these are the legacy hard-coded
                    dashboard tiles, now opt-out-able per user.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Per-resource</strong> widgets — every
                    entry in a <code>ResourceDefinition.dashboard.widgets</code>{' '}
                    array contributes one catalog entry, grouped
                    under the resource&apos;s module name.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Widget keys are stable strings (<code>system:users</code>,{' '}
                  <code>products:total-products</code>, etc.) so the
                  saved layout doesn&apos;t break when widget order
                  changes in the definition.
                </p>

                <h3>Settings page</h3>
                <p>
                  At <code>/settings/dashboard</code>: three sections
                  (Cards / Charts / Tables), each with checkbox lists
                  grouped by module. Per-section{' '}
                  <em>Select all</em> /{' '}
                  <em>Deselect all</em>; per-module{' '}
                  <em>All</em> / <em>None</em> for fine-grained
                  configuration. Sidebar nav gets a new{' '}
                  &quot;Dashboard settings&quot; entry under System
                  (no admin gate; every user can customise their own
                  view).
                </p>

                <h3>Dashboard date filter</h3>
                <p>
                  The existing <code>DateFilter</code> component from
                  v3.31.34 is now on the dashboard too. URL-persisted
                  via <code>?date=preset</code> /{' '}
                  <code>?date_from</code> / <code>?date_to</code>;
                  initial value falls back to the saved{' '}
                  <code>date_preset</code> so a refresh keeps the
                  window. Every system widget query keys on the
                  active <code>dateParams</code> so changing the
                  filter retriggers a refetch with{' '}
                  <code>?created_since=7d</code> /{' '}
                  <code>?created_from=...&amp;created_to=...</code>{' '}
                  appended.
                </p>

                <h3>Migration</h3>
                <p>
                  New scaffolded projects ship everything wired up. To
                  add to an existing project, run <code>grit upgrade</code>{' '}
                  (which writes the new files), then hand-add the
                  model to <code>models/user.go</code>&apos;s{' '}
                  <code>Models()</code> list and the routes to{' '}
                  <code>routes.go</code> — or rerun the upgrade with{' '}
                  <code>--force</code> if you haven&apos;t customised
                  those files. The existing hand-coded dashboard
                  page keeps working with no changes; the new
                  filtering activates only after you replace
                  <code>app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx</code>{' '}
                  with the v3.31.40 template (it reads{' '}
                  <code>useDashboardLayout()</code> and{' '}
                  <code>resolveEnabledKeys()</code>).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Heads-up for early adopters: the v3.31.40 framework
                  scaffold ships the building blocks (model + handler
                  + catalog + hook + Settings page + sidebar entry)
                  but does <em>not</em> auto-rewrite the dashboard
                  page — that lands in a follow-up release once the
                  multi-style dashboard variants (default / modern /
                  minimal / glass) are all refactored to use the new
                  layout reader. Until then, the example dashboard
                  refactor in the docs walks you through the changes
                  by hand.

                  <code>identifier</code> is the human-readable label
                  (name, title, slug, sku); it must never be blank —
                  the helper falls back to <code>(unnamed)</code> if
                  the caller hands it an empty string. <code>detail</code>
                  is optional extra context (price for Create, diff
                  for Update) and only renders when non-empty.

                  digit lands. Helps catch zero-count mistakes (the
                  &quot;is that 30k or 300k?&quot; problem) without

                  plain JS number, and the API still receives an int
                  or float as before.

                  <code>&quot;numeric&quot;</code> for int/uint columns).
                  The visible value is the comma-formatted string; the
                  field also keeps a parsed JS number in form state.
                  Mobile keyboards still pop up correctly thanks to{' '}
                  <code>inputMode</code>; the comma can render literally
                  because text inputs don&apos;t strip non-digits.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Cursor position is preserved across the reformat by
                  counting non-comma characters before the caret and
                  restoring after the same count in the new value, so
                  editing in the middle of a number doesn&apos;t fling
                  the caret to the end.

                <p>
                  Tells the input which characters to accept:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><code>int</code> — negatives yes, decimals no</li>

                  don&apos;t set <code>numberKind</code> stay
                  permissive — no breaking change to your existing

                  <li><strong>Backspace through a comma</strong> — the comma re-inserts after the digit is removed; caret tracks digit count, not column position</li>
                  <li><strong>Leading zeros</strong> — &quot;0123&quot; collapses to &quot;123&quot;; &quot;0&quot; stays &quot;0&quot; so &quot;0.5&quot; is reachable</li>
                  <li><strong>External value sync</strong> — opening Edit on an existing record formats the loaded number; subsequent typing skips the sync to avoid stomping mid-edit state</li>

                  <code>buildDefaults</code> in <code>form-builder.tsx</code>{' '}
                  seeded every non-toggle field to <code>&quot;&quot;</code>{' '}
                  (empty string). For <code>files</code> /{' '}
                  <code>images</code> / <code>videos</code> types,
                  react-hook-form&apos;s initial state was therefore a
                  string. The matching field component (<code>FilesField</code>,{' '}
                  <code>ImagesField</code>, <code>VideosField</code>)
                  immediately called <code>.map()</code> on that
                  &quot;array&quot; — strings have no <code>.map</code>{' '}
                  → TypeError → the parent <code>FormSheet</code> blew
                  up into Next.js&apos; error boundary. The user saw
                  &quot;Something went wrong&quot;.
                </p>

                <h3>The fix</h3>
                <p>
                  <code>buildDefaults</code> now branches by field type:
                  arrays default to <code>[]</code>, nullable objects
                  (<code>file</code> / <code>image</code> /{' '}
                  <code>video</code>) default to <code>null</code>,
                  toggles stay <code>false</code>, everything else

} else if (NULLABLE_OBJECT_FIELD_TYPES.has(field.type)) {
  defaults[field.key] = null;
}`}</code></pre>
                <p>
                  All three field components also got a defensive{' '}
                  <code>Array.isArray</code> guard so a stale form or
                  a deserialised-wrong API response can&apos;t crash
                  the dropzone — the field just renders empty and the
                  user can still upload.

                <pre><code>{`func (f FileRef) Value() (driver.Value, error) {
  return json.Marshal(f)   // returns []byte

                <p>
                  Go&apos;s <code>database/sql</code> accepts{' '}
                  <code>[]byte</code> as a valid driver.Value — and
                  lib/pq (the standard Postgres driver) encodes{' '}
                  <code>[]byte</code> as <code>bytea</code>, Postgres&apos;
                  binary type. Postgres then tries to insert the bytea
                  blob into a <code>json</code> column, fails to parse
                  the framing, and rejects with SQLSTATE 22P02.
                </p>

                <h3>The fix</h3>
                <p>
                  Both <code>Value()</code> implementations now convert
                  the JSON bytes to a Go string before returning:
                </p>
                <pre><code>{`func (f FileRef) Value() (driver.Value, error) {
  b, err := json.Marshal(f)
  if err != nil {
    return nil, err
  }
  return string(b), nil   // text, not bytea
}`}</code></pre>
                <p>
                  lib/pq sends string values as plain text, which
                  Postgres parses as JSON cleanly. SQLite and MySQL
                  are tolerant of both shapes; only Postgres was
                  strict.
                </p>

                <h3>Regression guards</h3>
                <p>
                  Two new tests in the scaffolded{' '}
                  <code>file_ref_test.go</code> assert that{' '}
                  <code>Value()</code> returns a <code>string</code>{' '}
                  type — so a future contributor can&apos;t silently
                  revert to <code>[]byte</code> without CI catching it.
                  The tests fail with a clear message pointing at the
                  Postgres bytea-vs-json issue.
                </p>

                <h3>Migration</h3>
                <p>

                  <strong>Excel import + export, fully client-side via
                  SheetJS.</strong> Continues the data ops arc. Every
                  resource list page now ships with a three-format
                  download menu (CSV / Excel / JSON) and a drag-and-drop
                  Excel import that previews, validates, and submits
                  rows without a single new API route.
                </p>

                <h3>Why client-side</h3>
                <p>
                  The original v3.31.35 plan put export and import on
                  the server: <code>excelize</code> for writing,{' '}
                  <code>asynq</code> + Resend for the
                  &gt;5000-row async cutoff, a new{' '}
                  <code>/import</code> endpoint with template +
                  validation. Doing it in the browser via SheetJS{' '}
                  (<code>xlsx ^0.18.5</code>) collapses all of that —
                  no new routes, no async wiring, no &quot;your file
                  is ready&quot; email loop, and tenant row data
                  never leaves the user&apos;s session just to build
                  a file.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Trade-off: very large datasets (~50k+ rows) are
                  gated by the browser&apos;s memory ceiling, not
                  server RAM. The export menu still streams every
                  page from the API before building the file, so the
                  output represents the whole filtered dataset —
                  not just what&apos;s on screen.
                </p>

                  enabled, else CSV); the chevron opens a menu with
                  the other formats. Uses the active search, sort,
                  filters, and date range so an export honours the
                  view the user is looking at.
                </p>

                <h3>ImportModal</h3>
                <p>
                  Three stages — file pick → validation preview →
                  submit with progress bar. The preview surfaces
                  per-row errors with field+reason, flags unknown
                  header columns, and disables Import when nothing
                  is valid. On submit, React Query invalidates the
                  resource list so the table reflects the new rows.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Header matching is loose: spaces, underscores,
                  hyphens, and case are normalised before lookup, so
                  the same template works whether a user&apos;s spreadsheet
                  has <code>first_name</code>, <code>First Name</code>,
                  or <code>firstname</code>.
                </p>

                    <code>by_kind</code> — count + size grouped by
                    MIME bucket (image / video / audio / pdf /
                    document / spreadsheet / other). Single SQL
                    GROUP BY with portable CASE expression — works on
                    Postgres and SQLite without engine-specific JSON
                    functions.

                <h3>Storage stats panel</h3>
                <p>
                  The Files admin page now shows three big numbers up
                  top (Total files / Total storage / Avg file size),
                  then a per-kind breakdown with proportional progress
                  bars sorted by largest consumer. Image-heavy
                  projects can see at a glance whether to migrate to a
                  CDN; CSV-heavy projects can spot a runaway export
                  pipeline.
                </p>

                <h3>Dropzone variant standardisation</h3>
                <p>
                  Default + Compact variants now route their uploading
                  state through the unified{' '}
                  <code>&lt;UploadProgress&gt;</code> component so the
                  per-field <code>progress</code> prop (bar / circular
                  / pulse) actually takes effect on both. Minimal,
                  Avatar, and Inline variants are space-constrained
                  by design and keep their bespoke single-spinner
                  treatment.
                </p>

                <p>
                  v3.31.33 ships the file lifecycle work: immediate
                  S3 delete when a record swaps its file, plus a
                  daily orphan-cleanup cron that purges Upload rows
                  whose key is referenced nowhere. v3.31.34 begins
                  the data ops arc — date filter, Excel
                  import/export, PDF render via @react-pdf/renderer.

                <h3>Bug fix from v3.31.30</h3>
                <p>
                  The Dropzone was still reading{' '}
                  <code>data.original_name</code> and{' '}
                  <code>data.mime_type</code> from the upload response,
                  but v3.31.30 changed{' '}
                  <code>POST /api/uploads</code> to return a FileRef
                  shape with <code>data.name</code> and{' '}
                  <code>data.mime</code>. Files uploaded after v3.31.30
                  appeared with the generic File client-side fallback
                  name instead of the real filename from the server.
                  Now reads both shapes (FileRef first, legacy
                  fallback) so cross-version compatibility holds.
                </p>
                <p>
                  UploadedFile also carries the explicit <code>key</code>{' '}
                  field now, so the FileField bridge round-trips the
                  S3 key losslessly instead of recomputing it from
                  the URL pathname.
                </p>

                <h3>Three progress variants</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>bar</strong> (default) — linear progress
                    bar with spinner + percentage label.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>circular</strong> — donut with the % inside.
                    SVG, no extra dependency.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>pulse</strong> — three pulsing dots + %.
                    Minimal chrome for compact contexts.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Pick a variant per field:
                </p>
                <pre><code>{`{ key: "avatar", type: "file", accepts: ["image"], progress: "circular" }`}</code></pre>
                <p>
                  The Default dropzone variant routes its uploading
                  state through the new <code>&lt;UploadProgress&gt;</code>{' '}
                  component. The other four dropzone variants (compact /
                  minimal / avatar / inline) keep their bespoke inline
                  progress UI for now — v3.31.32 standardises them.
                </p>

                <h3>Type-aware FilePreview</h3>
                <p>
                  Single image preview stays as a thumbnail. Video gets
                  a play badge over a dark thumb. Audio shows a music
                  icon. PDF / Word / Excel / CSV render format-specific
                  glyphs with colour-coded tints (PDF red, Word blue,
                  Excel green). Everything else falls back to the
                  generic File icon.
                </p>

                <h3>Reorder by up/down arrows</h3>
                <p>
                  Multi-file (<code>:files:</code>) preview rows now
                  show small up/down arrow buttons when{' '}
                  <code>reorderable</code> is true (default). Adjacent
                  swap; first row&apos;s up button is disabled, last
                  row&apos;s down button is disabled. No new
                  dependencies — drag-reorder via dnd-kit is a future
                  polish.
                </p>

                <h3>Resource def knobs</h3>
                <p>

                <p>
                  Resource mutations all called{' '}
                  <code>invalidateQueries(&#123; queryKey: [endpoint] &#125;)</code>{' '}
                  on success, expecting React Query&apos;s
                  prefix-matching to invalidate every query under that
                  resource. But the stat-card query in{' '}
                  <code>PageHeader</code> was keyed with{' '}
                  <code>[&quot;stat&quot;, endpoint, field]</code> —
                  starting with the literal string{' '}
                  <code>&quot;stat&quot;</code>, not the endpoint. The
                  invalidation never matched it, and a{' '}
                  <code>staleTime: 30_000</code> meant the value didn&apos;t
                  even auto-refetch for 30 seconds.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Stats also use endpoints with query-string suffixes
                  (e.g.{' '}
                  <code>/api/products?page_size=1&amp;created_since=7d</code>),
                  so even if the key had started with the endpoint
                  string, it wouldn&apos;t have matched the bare
                  <code> /api/products</code> the mutation invalidates.
                </p>

                <h3>The fix</h3>
                <p>
                  Stat queryKey now starts with the <em>base</em> endpoint
                  (no query string):{' '}
                  <code>[endpoint.split(&quot;?&quot;)[0], &quot;stat&quot;, endpoint, field]</code>.
                  Mutation invalidation prefix-matches it, and the staleTime
                  is gone so the cards refetch immediately on success.

                </p>

                <h3>The bug</h3>
                <p>
                  <code>ResourcePage</code> declared a few hooks at
                  the top (<code>useRouter</code>,{' '}
                  <code>useSearchParams</code>), then performed{' '}
                  <em>early returns</em> for the form-page case
                  (<code>action=create</code> or <code>action=edit</code>),
                  then declared ~20 more hooks below
                  (<code>useState</code>, <code>useResource</code>,{' '}
                  <code>useMemo</code>, <code>useCallback</code> x many).
                  When the URL changed and the component switched
                  between list mode and form mode, the hook count
                  changed between renders — React 19 throws &quot;Rendered
                  fewer hooks than expected.&quot;
                </p>

                <h3>The fix</h3>
                <p>
                  Split <code>ResourcePage</code> into a thin router
                  shell + a separate <code>ResourceListView</code>{' '}
                  component. The router only calls{' '}
                  <code>useSearchParams</code> and the routing
                  helpers, then either renders one of the form
                  variants or delegates to <code>ResourceListView</code>.
                  The list view owns all 20+ list-mode hooks. Each
                  function now has a stable hook count across
                  renders, and the form path never mounts the
                  list-mode hooks (so it doesn&apos;t spawn an
                  unnecessary <code>useResource</code> fetch either).

                  the lack of full ANSI cursor-up support meant each

                  <code>injectBefore</code> for a new resource, it
                  found that occurrence first (above the function,
                  outside any function body) and inserted every case

                  <strong>Audit trail for public form submissions.</strong>{' '}
                  The last deferred item from PLAN_FORMS_AND_SHARING.md.
                  Operators can now see every submission that came in
                  through each share — with timestamp, IP, and
                  User-Agent.
                </p>

                <h3>What landed</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>New <code>FormSubmission</code> model</strong>{' '}
                    — one row per successful public submission. Captures
                    share_id, resource_name, record_id, IP, User-Agent,
                    timestamp. Soft-deletable for retention.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong><code>PublicSubmit</code> writes the audit
                    row</strong> after a successful dispatch. Best-effort:
                    failure to write the audit row does NOT roll back
                    the user&apos;s submission. They still get their
                    record; the admin just misses one line in the
                    trail.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>New admin endpoint:</strong>{' '}
                    <code>GET /api/admin/form-submissions?share_id=&amp;resource_name=</code>{' '}
                    — paginated audit log, filterable by share or
                    resource.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Admin UI:</strong> the /system/form-shares
                    page gains an <em>Audit</em> button per share.
                    Click → modal listing the 100 most recent
                    submissions for that share with timestamp, record
                    ID, IP, and a truncated UA tooltip.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Why a separate table, not a column</h3>
                <p>
                  An earlier draft considered adding{' '}
                  <code>source_share_id</code> as a column on every
                  scaffolded model. That approach is invasive — every
                  existing project would need a migration to add the
                  column to Contact / Application / Lead / etc. The
                  audit-table approach is purely additive: new project
                  or existing,{' '}
                  <code>grit migrate</code> creates the new{' '}
                  <code>form_submissions</code> table and existing
                  models stay untouched.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Bonus: the audit table captures richer data than a
                  column could (IP + User-Agent), which is useful for
                  spam triage and compliance.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Use <code>--public-share</code> when you want a
                  branded public form at your own URL
                  (<code>/contact-us</code>, <code>/apply</code>,{' '}
                  <code>/leads</code>) instead of the default{' '}
                  <code>/forms/[token]</code> page. The dispatcher,
                  rate limits, and password gate behave identically;
                  only the URL and styling are yours to control.
                </p>

                  <strong>Going public</strong> — with three lessons
                  covering the post-resource lifecycle:

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>grit expose form / table</strong> — when
                    to use each, anatomy of the commands, field
                    filtering, combining with form sharing.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Public form sharing</strong> — the dispatch
                    pattern, password gating, sharing the link,
                    disabling and regenerating, what it can&apos;t
                    do (yet).
                  </li>
                  <li>

                    vs ProtectedWebRoute, when each one fits, how
                    they layer.

                  <code>internal/expose</code> now has 10 unit tests
                  covering the security-critical field filter
                  (autoFields drops framework columns, pointer + value
                  associations, slice associations; keeps all 7
                  primitive types), label generation (acronym
                  handling), and the pluralisation helpers
                  (pluralPascal, pluralKebab). Plus path validation
                  for resolveTarget. All passing.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Up from 10 in the previous release. The chapter
                  covers the full resource lifecycle from initial
                  generation through customisation, sharing,
                  exposure, and protection — end to end.

                  forgot-password pages and a <code>useMe()</code>{' '}
                  hook. What was missing: a way to mark <em>which</em>{' '}
                  customer-facing pages require sign-in.{' '}
                  <code>grit add web-auth</code> closes that gap with
                  two complementary patterns.
                </p>

                <h3>Files scaffolded</h3>

                  <li>
                    <strong><code>apps/web/middleware.ts</code></strong>{' '}
                    — SSR cookie redirect. Runs on every Next.js
                    request, checks for the{' '}
                    <code>grit_access</code> HttpOnly cookie, redirects
                    to <code>/login?next=…</code> when missing on a
                    protected path. Also bounces already-signed-in
                    visitors off the login/register pages so they
                    don&apos;t see a form they don&apos;t need. Edit
                    the <code>PROTECTED_PATHS</code> and{' '}
                    <code>AUTH_PATHS</code> arrays to customise.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>
                      <code>apps/web/components/ProtectedWebRoute.tsx</code>
                    </strong>{' '}
                    — client-side wrapper. Wraps a page with{' '}
                    <code>&lt;ProtectedWebRoute&gt;{`{children}`}
                    &lt;/ProtectedWebRoute&gt;</code> to enforce auth
                    in cases where middleware can&apos;t help — e.g.
                    role-gated content (the cookie doesn&apos;t carry
                    the role; <code>useMe()</code> returns the full
                    user). Supports an optional{' '}
                    <code>roles</code> prop.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The two patterns</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Middleware (SSR)</strong> — fast, no
                    network round-trip per request, no flash of
                    unauthorized content. Use for "is the visitor
                    signed in?" pages: account dashboards, checkout,
                    member-only content.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>ProtectedWebRoute (client)</strong> —
                    makes a real <code>/api/auth/me</code> probe.
                    Catches expired-but-present cookies and supports
                    role checks. Use it when middleware isn&apos;t
                    enough.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Behavior</h3>
                <p>
                  Both files are idempotent — re-running{' '}
                  <code>grit add web-auth</code> without{' '}
                  <code>--force</code> skips existing files. The
                  scaffold prints a clear notice so operators know
                  what was created and what was preserved.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Two new CLI commands that scaffold a Next.js page in{' '}
                  <code>apps/web/</code> for an existing resource. The
                  page consumes the auto-generated React Query hook
                  directly, so you get list/create flows on a
                  customer-facing site without re-implementing
                  anything.
                </p>

                <h3>Commands</h3>
                <pre className="overflow-x-auto rounded-lg bg-bg-elevated p-3 text-xs"><code>{`grit expose form Contact --to apps/web/app/contact-us/page.tsx
grit expose table Contact --to apps/web/app/contacts/page.tsx`}</code></pre>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Each command parses{' '}
                    <code>apps/api/internal/models/&lt;snake&gt;.go</code>{' '}
                    to determine the resource's primitive fields.
                    Relationship pointers (<code>Group *Group</code> or{' '}
                    <code>Group Group</code>) and slices
                    (<code>Tags []Tag</code>) are filtered out — only
                    fields that can render as one <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>{' '}
                    or one table cell make it through.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Both commands refuse to overwrite an existing file
                    unless you pass <code>--force</code> — protects
                    hand-customised pages from accidental loss.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Generated pages are plain Tailwind (no admin
                    chrome), suitable for embedding on a marketing
                    site or a customer dashboard.

                    now branches its <code>apiClient</code> import
                    path by app — <code>@/lib/api-client</code> for

                <h3>Known limitations</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Generated forms don't use the shared Zod schema for
                    validation — the schema's camelCase field names
                    don't match the API's snake_case JSON keys. Forms
                    submit snake-case keys directly; server-side
                    validation is the source of truth. Add client-side
                    validation by hand if you need it.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Forms have one field per primitive column. Custom
                    widgets (rich text, image uploaders, relationship
                    dropdowns) need manual additions after generation.

                    <code>--public-share</code> / <code>--public</code>{' '}
                    flags (post via the public form-share endpoint
                    instead of via the auth'd hook) are still on the

                <p>

                  Long Update views with 10+ fields used to save the
                  whole record on every click — risky when two operators
                  edit different sections at once, slow because the
                  payload is large, and tedious because every field had
                  to be re-validated.{' '}
                  <strong>Define <code>form.groups</code></strong> and
                  each group renders as its own Card on the Update page,
                  with its own Save button that PATCHes only that
                  group&apos;s fields.

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>New <code>Patch</code> handler</strong> on
                    every generated resource. Whitelists writable columns
                    so the partial endpoint can&apos;t be tricked into
                    setting <code>id</code> / <code>created_at</code> /
                    <code>deleted_at</code> / <code>version</code> from
                    the client.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>PATCH /api/&lt;plural&gt;/:id</strong> route
                    registered alongside PUT for every resource (both
                    standard and role-restricted route groups).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong><code>usePatchResource(endpoint)</code></strong>{' '}
                    hook in the admin&apos;s use-resource module.
                    Same shape as <code>useUpdateResource</code> but
                    calls PATCH and toasts &quot;Saved&quot; on
                    success.

                    on <code>FormDefinition.groups</code>. Each group is{' '}

                  </li>

                    <strong><code>&lt;UpdateGroups&gt;</code></strong>{' '}
                    component renders each <code>scope: "update"</code>{' '}
                    or <code>"both"</code> group as a separate Card on
                    the Update page (when{' '}

                  <li>
                    ResourcePage dispatcher: when editing + groups
                    present, route to <code>UpdateGroups</code>;
                    otherwise fall back to the single-form FormPage.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The "create-and-update" pattern</h3>
                <p>
                  Use <code>scope: "create"</code> on the minimal
                  required fields and <code>scope: "update"</code> on
                  the rest. Operators get a frictionless Create form;
                  detailed editing happens on the Update page as cards
                  with partial saves.
                </p>

                <h3>Deferred to v3.31.19</h3>
                <p>
                  Group rendering on the Create flow as a multi-step
                  wizard. The existing <code>steps</code> field still
                  works for that. v3.31.19 unifies them so groups drive
                  both contexts.

                  <code>"modal"</code> renders as a proper centered
                  dialog instead of a sheet. Defaults are unchanged —
                  resources without an explicit <code>formView</code>{' '}
                  still get the long-form-friendly drawer.
                </p>

                <h3>The three rendering choices</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong><code>"sheet"</code></strong> (default) —
                    right drawer on desktop, bottom sheet on mobile.
                    Best for long forms and multi-line fields.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong><code>"modal"</code></strong> — centered
                    dialog over a backdrop. Best for short focused
                    forms (1–6 fields).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong><code>"page"</code></strong> — dedicated
                    route via <code>?action=create|edit</code>. Best
                    for very long forms or anything that needs
                    shareable URLs.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What shipped</h3>

                    New <code>FormSheet</code> component
                    (apps/admin/components/forms/form-sheet.tsx) — the
                    long-form-friendly drawer, formerly the
                    implementation of FormModal.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <code>FormModal</code> rewritten as a proper
                    centered dialog (max-w-md, backdrop blur, padding).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <code>ResourcePage</code> dispatcher picks the
                    right component based on <code>resource.formView</code>.
                  </li>

                <h3>Migrating</h3>

                  If you previously set <code>formView: "modal"</code>{' '}
                  explicitly and want the old sheet behavior, change
                  it to <code>"sheet"</code>. Resources that left{' '}
                  <code>formView</code> undefined stay on the sheet —

                  <code>grit migrate</code> + <code>grit sync</code>,
                  and the field now appears in{' '}
                  <code>apps/admin/resources/&lt;plural&gt;.ts</code>{' '}
                  as both a column and a form input — with a sensible
                  default type inferred from the Go type. Customised
                  entries (labels, helper text, badges, custom{' '}
                  <code>cell</code> renderers) are never touched.
                </p>

                <h3>How it works</h3>
                <p>
                  The generator now emits marker comments around the
                  auto-managed columns + form fields:
                </p>
                <pre className="overflow-x-auto rounded-lg bg-bg-elevated p-3 text-xs"><code>{`columns: [
  // grit:cols:auto-start
  { key: "name", ... },
  // grit:cols:auto-end
],
form: {
  fields: [
    // grit:fields:auto-start
    { key: "name", ... },
    // grit:fields:auto-end
  ],
},`}</code></pre>
                <p>
                  Sync diffs Go model fields against the file. For each
                  field with a <code>key:</code> not found anywhere in
                  the file, it inserts a default entry above the{' '}
                  <code>auto-end</code> marker. Sync is{' '}
                  <strong>insert-only</strong> — it never modifies or
                  removes existing entries.
                </p>

                <h3>Backward compatibility</h3>
                <p>
                  Resources scaffolded before v3.31.16 don&apos;t carry
                  the marker comments. Sync prints a per-resource
                  warning and skips them. To enable auto-add on an
                  existing resource, hand-edit the file to wrap its
                  columns array and form fields array with the four
                  marker lines once. After that, future syncs pick the
                  file up.
                </p>

                  Setting <code>SOCIAL_AUTH_ENABLED=false</code> in the
                  monorepo&apos;s root <code>.env</code> didn&apos;t hide the
                  Google / GitHub buttons even after a server restart — Next.js
                  only auto-loads <code>.env</code> from its own package
                  directory (<code>apps/admin/</code>, <code>apps/web/</code>),

                  <code>next.config.ts</code> was <code>undefined</code> and

                <p>
                  Both scaffolded <code>next.config.ts</code> files now read
                  the root <code>.env</code> directly via a tiny inline
                  parser before the <code>env</code> block is evaluated. Shell
                  env still wins (only unset keys are filled in), so CI / Docker
                  overrides are unaffected. After upgrading, restart{' '}
                  <code>pnpm dev</code> (Next.js reads env at boot, not on

                  <code>/auth/callback</code>. The cookies travel on the

                  needs to read <code>access_token</code> and{' '}
                  <code>refresh_token</code> from the URL. Tokens never
                  appear in browser history, server access logs, or Referer

                <p>
                  In a web project, <code>grit start</code> (no subcommand) was
                  falling through to <code>cmd.Help()</code> — printing the
                  available subcommands and exiting. The command&apos;s own
                  <code>Long</code> description said it would start both the
                  API and the client, but only <code>grit start server</code>{' '}
                  and <code>grit start client</code> actually did anything.

                  MinIO on 9000 + 9001. The host-port shifts only affect how you
                  reach them from your laptop. Prod compose is unchanged because
                  inter-container traffic uses the docker network hostnames
                  (<code>redis</code>, <code>minio</code>) and container ports.

                    <strong>Clean SQLite uncomment line.</strong> The commented-out SQLite
                    DSN previously had multiple leading spaces (<code># &nbsp;&nbsp;DATABASE_URL=sqlite:...</code>),
                    so removing the <code>#&nbsp;</code> left a line with leading
                    whitespace. godotenv tolerated it, but it was ugly and confusing.
                    Now single-<code>#</code>-prefixed for a clean uncomment.

                    <strong>Smart <code>grit update</code></strong> — first

                    from the prebuilt archive and never touched Go.

                  <strong>Performance hardening release.</strong> A senior-level audit of
                  every scaffold template found 27 issues — the 10 critical and high-impact
                  ones are fixed. Apps built with Grit should now show materially lower CPU
                  burn under sustained load.
                </p>

                <h3>Critical fixes</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>ActivityLogger middleware</strong> — was spawning a fresh goroutine
                    per request, each blocking on a row-level <code>FOR UPDATE</code> lock for
                    the audit hash chain. At 10k req/s the old design created 10k goroutines
                    all serializing on the same lock. Replaced with a bounded channel (4096) +
                    single writer goroutine. The single-writer design eliminates the lock
                    entirely (chain ordering is sequential by construction); the bounded
                    channel caps memory + goroutine count under traffic spikes. Drops on
                    overflow rather than OOM, with a new <code>AuditDroppedCount()</code>{' '}
                    helper for monitoring saturation.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong><code>audit.VerifyChain</code></strong> — was loading the entire{' '}
                    <code>activity_log</code> table into memory before scanning. At 1M rows
                    that's 250MB+ heap, instant OOM at 100M. Now walks in chunks of 1000 rows
                    with a cursor on <code>(created_at, id)</code>, honours{' '}
                    <code>context</code> cancellation, and the integrity endpoint passes a
                    60-second deadline so a runaway scan can't hold the connection forever.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>High-priority fixes</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong><code>flags.Engine.evaluate</code></strong> — copies the flag
                    struct under <code>RLock</code> then releases <em>before</em> doing all
                    decision logic (date checks, allowlist scans, bucketing, JSON parsing).
                    Cuts lock-hold time from milliseconds to nanoseconds on the flag-check
                    hot path.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Cache middleware</strong> — SHA-256 cache keys swapped for FNV-1a.
                    ~50× faster on the hot path of every cacheable request, no correctness
                    loss (cache keys don't need cryptographic strength).{' '}
                    <code>responseCapture</code> switches <code>[]byte</code> append to{' '}
                    <code>bytes.Buffer</code> — 3 allocations instead of one per Write chunk.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Generated service queries</strong> — <code>Update</code> dropped
                    the redundant third <code>First()</code> after <code>Updates()</code>{' '}
                    (Updates mutates the loaded struct in place); <code>Delete</code> dropped
                    the preflight <code>First()</code> (GORM's Delete is atomic + RowsAffected
                    reveals existence). 2 queries saved per generated CRUD op.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Generated Export handler</strong> — was loading every matching
                    row with <code>Find(&items)</code>; now uses{' '}
                    <code>FindInBatches</code> in chunks of 1000. CSV exports stream directly
                    to the response writer (true streaming, constant memory). XLSX still
                    buffers because excelize has no streaming API, but the scan is chunked
                    so we don't hold the entire result set in one slice. New{' '}
                    <code>export.CSVRows()</code> helper for header-less subsequent batches.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Medium fixes</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Webhook Replay</strong> — <code>retry_count</code> increment is
                    now atomic via <code>gorm.Expr("retry_count + ?", 1)</code>. Two
                    concurrent replays of the same event no longer race to write the same
                    +1 result.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Flags <code>bucketFor</code> for anonymous users</strong> —{' '}
                    <code>crypto/rand.Read</code> instead of{' '}
                    <code>time.Now().UnixNano() % 100</code>. The old approach was biased
                    toward recent buckets under high QPS.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Skill file: Performance &amp; Production Hygiene section</h3>

                  The <code>.claude/skills/grit/SKILL.md</code> that{' '}
                  <code>grit new</code> generates now includes a dedicated{' '}

                  helping users build apps will see explicit hot-path rules, DB query rules,
                  background job rules, logging rules, and memory rules — including which
                  framework primitives are already audited (so they know not to reintroduce
                  the patterns this release just fixed). Examples:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Never spawn unbounded goroutines per-request — use a buffered channel +
                    fixed worker pool (the ActivityLogger pattern).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Never hold a mutex across slow operations — read shared state, copy what
                    you need, release, then do the work (the flags.evaluate pattern).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Never load a whole table into memory — use{' '}
                    <code>paginate.List</code>, <code>FindInBatches</code>, or cursor walks
                    (the VerifyChain pattern).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Never use <code>time.Now().UnixNano() % N</code> for randomness — biased
                    by call frequency; use <code>crypto/rand</code>.

                <p>
                  Feature flags + A/B testing baked into the framework (
                  <a className="text-primary hover:underline" href="https://github.com/MUKE-coder/grit/issues/46" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#46</a>).
                  No LaunchDarkly bolt-on, no PostHog SaaS dependency — the engine,
                  the model, the admin endpoints, and the realtime push all ship in
                  every scaffolded API.
                </p>

                <h3>Usage</h3>
                <pre><code>{`if flags.IsEnabled(c, "new_dashboard") {
    // … render the new dashboard
}

switch flags.Variant(c, "checkout_redesign") {
case "control":   /* old flow */
case "variant_a": /* new flow */
case "variant_b": /* alternate new flow */
}`}</code></pre>

                <h3>Mechanics</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <code>FeatureFlag.Rules</code> JSON holds <code>rollout_percentage</code>,{' '}
                    <code>allowlist_user_ids</code>, <code>blocklist_user_ids</code>,{' '}
                    <code>enabled_from</code>, <code>enabled_until</code>,{' '}
                    <code>variants</code>.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    All flags load into an in-memory cache at boot. A background
                    goroutine refreshes every 30s; admin writes trigger an immediate
                    refresh. Flag checks never hit the DB.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Sticky bucketing: <code>SHA-256(user_id || ":" || flag_name) % 100</code>.
                    A user always lands in the same bucket for a given flag — no
                    flicker between sessions.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Allowlist always passes (bypasses the percentage roll). Blocklist
                    always denies. Both run before the percentage check.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A/B mode kicks in when <code>Rules.Variants</code> is non-empty.{' '}
                    <code>Variant()</code> returns the bucket-mapped variant string.
                    Sticky per (user, flag).
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Realtime updates</h3>
                <p>
                  When a flag is created / updated / deleted, the engine refreshes
                  its cache and broadcasts a <code>"flag.updated"</code> realtime
                  event over the v3.12 WebSocket hub. Frontend subscribers can
                  invalidate their cache and refetch — flag changes propagate in &lt;1s
                  across all connected clients.
                </p>

                <h3>Admin endpoints</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <code>GET /api/admin/flags</code> — paginated list (searchable on
                    name + description, sortable on name / created_at / enabled).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <code>POST /api/admin/flags</code> — create. Name is unique +
                    immutable.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <code>PUT /api/admin/flags/:id</code> — update description / enabled
                    / rules. Bumps Version (the v3.14 optimistic-lock column).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <code>DELETE /api/admin/flags/:id</code> — remove + invalidate cache.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <code>GET /api/admin/flags/:id/exposures</code> — variant counts
                    for the rollout-health view: <code>{`[{ "variant": "enabled", "count": 4231 }, ...]`}</code>.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Fail-closed semantics</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Unknown flags return <code>false</code>. A typo in a flag name never
                    accidentally enables a feature.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Misconfigured <code>Rules</code> JSON also returns <code>false</code>{' '}
                    — the engine never panics on bad data.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Anonymous users (empty user_id) get a random bucket per request +
                    are not exposure-tracked. For sticky anonymous flags, pass a stable
                    identifier (session ID, device ID).
                  </li>

                  routes — the path param picks the registered provider. No per-provider
                  routing code in your app.

                  Tamper-evident audit log via append-only hash chain (
                  <a className="text-primary hover:underline" href="https://github.com/MUKE-coder/grit/issues/48" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#48</a>).
                  Builds on the v3.16 <code>ActivityLog</code> — every row now carries{' '}
                  <code>PrevHash</code> + <code>Hash</code> columns where{' '}
                  <code>Hash = SHA-256(PrevHash || canonical(row))</code>. Mutating any
                  row breaks the chain on the next verification pass.
                </p>

                <h3>The chain</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Genesis row</strong> has <code>PrevHash = ""</code>; every
                    subsequent row references the previous row's <code>Hash</code>.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Hash input is the <em>stable canonical form</em> of the
                    audit-relevant fields (user_id, method, path, status, payload digest,
                    IP, UA, duration, created_at unix-nano). ID + PrevHash + Hash
                    themselves are <em>not</em> in the canonical form — they're either
                    random (ID) or derived (Hash, PrevHash).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Insert uses <code>FOR UPDATE</code> lock on the latest row inside
                    the same transaction, so concurrent writes serialize cleanly without
                    forking the chain.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                    <code>audit.Canonical(entry)</code> — stable JSON bytes for hashing.

                  <li>
                    <code>audit.ComputeHash(prevHash, canonical)</code> — runs SHA-256
                    over <code>prevHash || canonical</code>; returns hex.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <code>audit.AppendChained(db, entry)</code> — atomic insert with
                    chain lock. The middleware uses this; you can call it from anywhere.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <code>audit.VerifyChain(db)</code> — walks every row in{' '}
                    <code>(created_at, id)</code> order and recomputes hashes. Returns{' '}
                    <code>ChainStatus</code> with the first mismatch (broken_at_id +
                    expected vs got + message).
                  </li>

                <h3>What it does NOT defend against</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Compromise of the running server itself — an attacker with code
                    execution can rewrite the entire chain.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    External anchoring (publishing the daily root hash to a public
                    ledger like a tweet, a transaction, or a Sigstore log) is the
                    follow-up — flagged in #48 as bonus material, not shipped here.

                  Verification cost: O(n) — about 2–3 seconds per million rows on a warm
                  cache. The middleware insert is still fire-and-forget so audit DB
                  latency never blocks the response path; chain failures log instead of
                  cascading.

                <h3>Cursor-based pagination — #43</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <code>paginate.List</code> gains opt-in cursor mode via{' '}
                    <code>Config.CursorMode: true</code>. Response carries{' '}

                    instead of <code>Page</code>/<code>Pages</code>.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Detects <code>HasMore</code> by fetching <code>PageSize + 1</code>{' '}
                    rows — no separate count query needed.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Cursor is opaque base64 of <code>(sort_value, id)</code> so pages
                    stay stable when rows insert mid-pagination. Works with any sort
                    field; extracts the value via reflection on the last row.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Total count opt-in via <code>Config.IncludeTotal</code> — costs an
                    extra <code>COUNT(*)</code>, leave off unless your UI shows a
                    &quot;X of Y&quot; indicator.
                  </li>
                  <li>

                  <strong>Offline-first foundation.</strong> Git-style sync model — work
                  locally, click Sync explicitly, resolve conflicts per-field, push
                  one-by-one. Every scaffolded API now has Version-tracked rows + the
                  POST /api/sync/push and GET /api/sync/pull endpoints; every desktop
                  scaffold ships a local SQLite mirror, an outbox with squash semantics,
                  and a title-bar Sync button + conflict-resolution dialog.
                </p>

                <h3>Server: versioning + sync endpoints</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <code>Version int</code> column added to User, Upload, Blog. A{' '}
                    <code>BeforeUpdate</code> GORM hook auto-increments on every
                    server-side write. The resource generator emits both on every new
                    model.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <code>POST /api/sync/push</code> accepts a batch of changes; each
                    entry includes the version the client believes the server has. On
                    mismatch the response contains <code>VERSION_CONFLICT</code> + the
                    current server state, so the client can drive a merge UI.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <code>GET /api/sync/pull?model=X&since=cursor</code> returns every
                    row in the table updated after the cursor, paginated, with a new
                    cursor in the response.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    New <code>internal/sync/registry.go</code> maps logical table names
                    (e.g. <code>"buildings"</code>) to <code>reflect.Type</code> so the
                    handler decodes dynamic payloads. New resources auto-register via{' '}
                    <code>// grit:sync</code> marker.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Desktop: sync engine</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    New <code>apps/desktop/sync/</code> Go package. Opens a local SQLite
                    file under the OS user-config dir on app boot.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Three tables: <code>sync_records</code> (local mirror — reads come
                    from here), <code>sync_outbox</code> (pending changes; UNIQUE on
                    (model, entity_id) for squash), <code>sync_cursors</code>{' '}
                    (incremental pull positions).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Squash semantics: edit a record three times offline → one outbox
                    entry with the final state. delete-after-create cancels both
                    locally without ever hitting the network.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <code>Engine.Sync()</code> runs Pull then Push. Push posts the whole
                    outbox in one HTTP call; the response drives per-entry result
                    handling — successes clear from the outbox, conflicts get the
                    server state stashed for the merge UI.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                  <li>
                    <code>LocalCreate</code> / <code>LocalUpdate</code> / <code>LocalDelete</code> —

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <code>LocalGet</code> / <code>LocalList</code> — read from the local mirror.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <code>Sync(tables)</code> — pull listed tables then push the outbox.
                    Returns counts.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <code>PendingCount</code>, <code>GetPendingChanges</code> — drive the
                    title-bar badge and the review panel.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <code>ResolveConflict(table, entityID, mergedData, serverVersion)</code> —
                    accepts the user's merge for a conflicted entry.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>UI</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Title-bar Sync button</strong> with a pending-count badge.
                    Green refresh icon when clean; amber alert + count when there are
                    pending changes.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>PendingChangesPanel</strong> — right-edge drawer listing
                    every outbox entry, split into &quot;Needs review&quot; (conflicts)
                    and &quot;Ready to push&quot;. <code>Sync now</code> button at the bottom.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>ConflictDialog</strong> — field-level merge UI. Three columns
                    (Field / Local / Server v_N), per-field click to choose. Apply
                    builds the merged record and calls <code>ResolveConflict</code>.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <code>usePendingCount()</code> — polls every 2s for the badge.

                  <li>
                    <code>usePendingChanges()</code> — full outbox + refresh function.

                  <li>
                    <code>useSyncMutation(tables)</code> — kicks off a Sync, exposes

                  </li>
                  <li>

                  New <code>grit generate sequence</code> command produces atomic, gap-free
                  sequential numbers like <code>INV-202605-0001</code>. Pattern lifted from a
                  real Grit-built rental management app — invoice / receipt / order numbering
                  is now a one-liner.
                </p>

                <h3>What it generates</h3>

                    <code>internal/sequence/sequence.go</code> — a generic counter package
                    with <code>Counter</code> (the GORM-backed row),{' '}
                    <code>Config</code> (name + prefix + reset + width), and an atomic{' '}
                    <code>Next(db, cfg, t)</code> helper.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Every invocation:</strong>{' '}
                    <code>internal/services/&lt;name&gt;_sequence.go</code> — a typed
                    convenience wrapper. Handlers call e.g.{' '}
                    <code>services.NextInvoiceNumber(h.DB, time.Now())</code> without
                    knowing the prefix or reset cadence.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Auto-injects <code>&sequence.Counter{'{}'}</code> into the{' '}
                    <code>Models()</code> migration slice (idempotent).
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Mechanics</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Counter rows keyed by <code>(name, bucket)</code> where bucket is{' '}
                    <code>"YYYYMM"</code> for monthly resets, <code>"YYYY"</code> for yearly,
                    or empty for never. So a monthly counter automatically restarts at 1
                    on the first call of each new month.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Atomic via row-level <code>SELECT FOR UPDATE</code> on Postgres
                    (concurrent callers serialize on the counter row). SQLite serializes
                    writes globally so it's also safe.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Usage</h3>
                <pre><code>{`grit generate sequence Invoice

                  <li>
                    <code>--prefix</code> — alphabetic prefix (default: first 3 chars of

                  </li>
                  <li>

                  Foundation release for upcoming offline-first work. Every scaffolded API
                  now ships with idempotent-retry semantics; every scaffolded client
                  auto-attaches an <code>Idempotency-Key</code> on mutations; and the
                  desktop scaffold gains a connection-status indicator backed by an
                  API heartbeat.
                </p>

                <h3>Idempotency middleware (API)</h3>

                    Activates only when the request carries an <code>Idempotency-Key</code> header
                    and the method is <code>POST</code>/<code>PUT</code>/<code>PATCH</code>/<code>DELETE</code>.

                  <li>
                    First 2xx response is cached in Redis for <strong>24 hours</strong>, keyed by{' '}
                    <code>(method, path, key)</code>. Subsequent requests with the same key replay
                    the cached response instead of re-executing the handler.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Errors (4xx/5xx) are intentionally <strong>not</strong> cached — clients can
                    retry transient failures with the same key.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Sets <code>Idempotent-Replayed: true</code> response header on cache hits so

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The 401-refresh path now reuses the same key when re-issuing a request after a
                    token refresh — so a token expiring mid-write can never double-create.
                  </li>

                  Patch release fixing compilation and consistency bugs in v3.9.0. Every

                  <li>
                    <strong>Missing imports</strong>: added <code>&quot;log&quot;</code> to <code>config.go</code>,{' '}

                  <li>
                    <strong>Stray package prefix</strong>: removed <code>handlers.</code> qualifier on{' '}

                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Desktop scaffold fixes</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <code>keychain.go</code> moved from <code>internal/</code> to the top level (the
                    subdirectory file was declaring <code>package main</code>, which Go rejects).
                  </li>

                <h3>Resource generator fixes</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Service signatures take <code>id string</code> instead of <code>id uint</code> --
                    matches the UUID string PK the models have always emitted.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Handler FK fields, handler M2M arrays, TS interface FK fields, and TanStack hook
                    ID types all switched to <code>string</code> (were <code>uint</code> /{' '}

                    <code>owner_id</code> → <code>OwnerID</code> (was <code>OwnerId</code>),{' '}

                    (snake → pascal → snake).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Zod schemas</strong> now emit snake_case field names matching the Go
                    handler&apos;s JSON tags (previously emitted camelCase, causing validation and
                    <code>ShouldBindJSON</code> mismatches).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Zod FK and M2M validators use <code>z.string().uuid()</code> instead of{' '}

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    FK columns generate with <code>gorm:&quot;size:36;index&quot;</code> (matches UUID PK width).

                    <strong>Desktop + mobile + API in one monorepo</strong> &mdash;{' '}
                    <code>grit new myapp --mobile --desktop</code> scaffolds a complete multi-client
                    SaaS: Go API shared by an Expo mobile app AND a Wails desktop app. All three
                    share the same <code>packages/shared</code> types and schemas.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Wails as a thin client</strong> &mdash; The new desktop app is a
                    frameless Wails window that calls the shared API over HTTP. No embedded Go
                    business logic, no local SQLite. Wails bindings are used only for native OS
                    features: window controls, file dialogs, and OS keychain (macOS Keychain,
                    Windows Credential Manager, Linux Secret Service) for JWT storage.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Distinct from <code>grit new-desktop</code></strong> &mdash; The
                    standalone offline-first desktop scaffold (<code>grit new-desktop</code>) is
                    unchanged. <code>--desktop</code> is a new, separate capability for
                    always-online multi-client apps.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Platform-aware window chrome</strong> &mdash; macOS traffic lights on
                    the left, Windows/Linux controls on the right. Detected at runtime via
                    <code>GetPlatform()</code> Wails binding.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Command palette</strong> (<code>⌘K</code>) &mdash; every scaffolded
                    desktop app ships with a Raycast/Linear-style command palette. Searchable
                    navigation + actions with keyboard-first UX.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Fixed 240px sidebar</strong> &mdash; not collapsible. Desktop windows
                    are wide enough; collapse toggles are a web pattern.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Global keyboard shortcuts</strong> &mdash;{' '}
                    <code>useShortcuts()</code> hook with defaults: <code>⌘K</code> palette,{' '}
                    <code>⌘,</code> settings, <code>⌘L</code> logout, <code>Esc</code> to close.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>More negative space</strong> &mdash; content padding is <code>32px</code>
                    (vs web&apos;s <code>24px</code>) for long focus sessions. Subtler shadows
                    (OS chrome already provides elevation).

                  <li>
                    New <strong>§14.5 Desktop App Patterns</strong> section in
                    <code>GRIT_STYLE_GUIDE.md</code> covering window chrome, sidebar (not

                    <code>apps/api/internal/</code> for monorepo). Generates React Query hooks and admin
                    resource pages for both Next.js and TanStack Router.

                  <li>
                    <strong><code>grit.json</code> project manifest</strong> &mdash; Every scaffolded project

                    <code>frontend</code> fields. The generator reads this to determine correct file paths
                    and template variants, eliminating fragile filesystem heuristics.

                    <strong><code>grit routes</code></strong> &mdash; List all registered API routes in a
                    formatted table. Parses <code>routes.go</code> and shows method, path, handler, and
                    middleware group (public/protected/admin). Works for both monorepo and single app projects.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong><code>grit down</code> / <code>grit up</code></strong> &mdash; Maintenance mode.
                    <code>grit down</code> creates a <code>.maintenance</code> file that triggers the new
                    maintenance middleware, returning 503 for all requests. <code>grit up</code> removes
                    it and resumes normal operation.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong><code>grit deploy</code></strong> &mdash; One-command production deployment.
                    Cross-compiles for Linux, builds frontend, uploads binary via SCP, configures a systemd
                    service, and optionally sets up Caddy reverse proxy with auto-TLS. Supports
                    <code>--host</code>, <code>--domain</code>, <code>--key</code> flags or
                    <code>DEPLOY_HOST</code>/<code>DEPLOY_DOMAIN</code>/<code>DEPLOY_KEY_FILE</code> env vars.

                    <code>Maintenance()</code> Gin middleware that checks for a <code>.maintenance</code>
                    file on every request. Runs as the first global middleware.

                    a single Go binary that serves both the API and an embedded React SPA. Uses <code>go:embed</code>
                    to bake the built frontend into the binary at compile time. One file to deploy. Dev mode runs
                    Go on <code>:8080</code> and Vite on <code>:5173</code> with API proxy.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Parameterized API paths</strong> &mdash; All Go API file generators now use

                    <strong>Desktop resource generation</strong> &mdash; <code>grit generate resource</code> now
                    works inside desktop projects. Generates Go model, service, and TanStack Router route files
                    (list, new, edit), then injects code into 10 locations (db.go, main.go, app.go, types.go,

                  <li>
                    <strong>Gzip response compression</strong> &mdash; All API responses are now
                    compressed automatically via a custom <code>Gzip()</code> middleware using the Go
                    standard library <code>compress/gzip</code> at <code>BestSpeed</code>.
                    JSON payloads shrink by 60–80%, reducing bandwidth on paginated list endpoints
                    with zero external dependencies.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Request ID tracing</strong> &mdash; A <code>RequestID()</code> middleware
                    injects a unique <code>X-Request-ID</code> header on every request (echoes the
                    upstream header or generates a nanosecond-based ID). The ID is stored in Gin
                    context and included in every structured log line for end-to-end request tracing.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Database connection pool tuning</strong> &mdash; The scaffold now sets
                    four GORM pool parameters: <code>MaxIdleConns(10)</code>,{' '}
                    <code>MaxOpenConns(100)</code>, <code>ConnMaxLifetime(30m)</code>, and{' '}
                    <code>ConnMaxIdleTime(10m)</code>. This prevents stale connections after network
                    interruptions and avoids connection exhaustion under load.

                    The browser gets a presigned PUT URL, uploads directly to S3/R2/MinIO, then records the upload
                    in the database. This fixes file uploads breaking behind reverse proxies (Dokploy/Traefik/Nginx)
                    due to request body size limits and timeouts. Includes progress tracking via XHR.

                <h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Scalar API docs crash</strong> &mdash; Fixed <code>c.String</code> treating HTML as
                    a format string. Now uses <code>c.Data</code> to avoid panics when Scalar HTML
                    contains <code>%</code> characters in CSS/JS.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Blog route conflict</strong> &mdash; Admin blog CRUD routes moved
                    from <code>/api/blogs</code> to <code>/api/admin/blogs</code> to avoid conflict
                    with public blog routes.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Select dropdown styling</strong> &mdash; Fixed relationship select dropdown
                    rendering behind modals using portal-based positioning.
                  </li>
                </ul>
